Smartphone users sue Apple, Facebook over mobile app privacy

18 social media firms slapped with lawsuit

By John Leyden

Posted in Law, 16th March 2012 12:16 GMT

Facebook, Twitter, Yelp and Apple, Foursquare and 13 other prominent social media firms have been hit with a lawsuit accusing them of supplying mobile applications that invade users' privacy.

The class-action lawsuit was filed by 13 private individuals in Austin, Texas [1]  where geek tech fest SXSW has just shut up shop. The suit accuses 18 companies of harvesting the address books of millions of smartphone users without their knowledge or informed consent.

"The defendants - several of the world's largest and most influential technology and social networking companies  have unfortunately made, distributed and sold mobile software applications that, once installed on a wireless mobile device, surreptitiously harvest, upload and illegally steal the owner's address book data without the owner's knowledge or consent," the lawsuit alleges, PC World reports [2].

The people behind the lawsuit are seeking a permanent injunction prohibiting such data collection and the destruction of data previously gathered. Those behind the lawsuit describe themselves as users of Apple's iPhone as well as Android-based smartphones.

The lawsuit comes against the backdrop of growing concerns about the handling of sensitive information on mobile phones. At the beginning of February it was discovered that social media iPhone apps from Path and Hipster were uploading user address book information without seeking the consent of smartphone users. Path apologised and promised to mend its ways. Days later, Twitter came under fire for failing to explain that its "Find Friends" service accessed users' smartphone address books.

Democrat Senator Charles Schumer was prompted to write to consumer watchdogs at the FTC [3] calling for action after the location-finding services on smartphones were also granted permission to siphon off users' photos on both iPhones and Android devices.

Smartphone security boffin Graham Lee recently told The Reg [4] that the app development industry might not be able to retain existing business models  thus forcing up prices  should a crackdown take place on the practice of info-slurping in exchange for targeted ad bucks.

Riding the Booster: Feel what it's like to hitch a ride on a rocket in this video below. Shot from the Solid Rocket Booster Perspective, the video goes through the entire trip on the Space Shuttle. The high-def video begins seconds before launch and ends about eight minutes later, when the spent boosters parachute into the ocean. It contains footage taken on two shuttle flights, STS-117 (June 2007) and STS-127 (July 2009), according to the video's closing credits. The video was assembled for a special edition of a DVD/BluRay entitled "Ascent: Commemorating Shuttle," according to NASA's Facebook page.(5:25pm) via YouTube

Mruniverse1952 Mr. Universe Turns 100: Manohar Aich, Mr. Universe in 1952, turned 100 recently and is still flexing. He told The Associated Press that his secret to longevity was a positive attitude, a simple, healthy diet and no alcohol or cigarettes. Just 4 foot 11 inches tall, Aich nevertheless developed a lifelong passion for weightlifting that started in the Indian Royal Airforce and took him through a stint in prison, to, eventually, a Mr. Universe title.

A Billion is How Much!?: Do youknow how much a billion is? It's a lot, but while the United States and the UK use 9 zeros equalling one thousand millions or 1,000,000^1.5; in France or Germany that's not a billion, it's a 'milliard.' In continental Europe one billion actually means one million millions or 1,000,000^2 which has 12 zeros. Similarly to our use of the English system instead of the metric system in the United States, we also use a different counting standard! Confused yet? The European system makes things easier to count, billion (bi) is one million squared, trillion is one million cubed, quadrillion is one million to the fourth power and so on. Then you can add a quadrillion to a trillion and know you can add the exponents: 4+3=7 which is a septillion or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.(2:03 p.m.) via The Guardian

Daydreaming = Genius: A new study suggests that minds that wander are minds that have a better working memory. "And working memory is itself directly associated to intelligence," says Gizmodo. The new study, conducted by the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Science, "suggests that a person's working memory capacity relates to the tendency of their mind to wander during routine tasks. Working memory is the capacity to remember information for short periods of time -- say, remembering a number while you dig out your phone." (1:15 p.m.) via Gizmodo 

Monster Mechanical Worms: Eight 1,000 ton mechanical worms have started a subterranean mega-engineering project under the streets of London. The 'worms' -- or more accurately: Tunnel Boring Machines (TBM) -- will construct 26 miles of new tunnels by 2018 and is currently Europe's largest civil engineering project. The 150-meter long TBMs will munch through 100 meters of rock per week and will be manned by 20 "tunnel gang" workers. Each TBM comes with a toilet and kitchen. (10:10 a.m.) via BBC News

Bilingual Brains: Smarter? Evidence is mounting that speaking more than one language makes a mind more agile. A New York Times analysis recently highlighted some of the research showing how bilingual people are better at mental puzzles as children and even into their senior years. The key advantage seems to come from a better ability to monitor the environment since a bilingual brain has to track which language is being spoken and then switch gears accordingly. There is even evidence to suggest that learning a language later in life can help keep your mind sharp. So time to bring back those flashcards? Oui! Da! Ja! Si! Shi! (9:15 a.m.) via New York Times

Jewish School Attack in France Leaves Teacher and 3 Children Dead: The gunman opened fire this morning in front of a Jewish school in Toulouse, France, shooting until his gun jammed and then switching to another gun as he entered the school, before fleeing the scene on a motorbike. A father and his two sons and one other child were killed in the attack. The father was also a Hebrew teacher at the school. The city is under lock-down as police look for the shooter. Last week a gunman on a motorbike with the same caliber weapon killed three soldiers in two different attacks in the area. (7:15 a.m.) via AFP

THE GIST

    * Using its gravitational dominance to 'vacuum' errant space rocks, Jupiter is often hailed as Earth's protector.
    * However, it is known that comets' orbits have been modified by Jupiter's gravity, sending them our way.

Whilst most famous for his catalog of 110 galaxies, nebulae, clusters and double stars, Charles Messier was a comet-hunter at heart. His catalog was simply a list of nuisances, faint fuzzies that looked like comets but were not.

The Frenchman found 13 comets in all between 1760 and 1785, but perhaps the most important of them was the streaking comet that he spotted in June 1770. Fast moving on the sky, it was bright enough at magnitude +2 that it could be clearly seen from well-lit towns and cities. A brief spectacle of wonder for eighteenth century astronomers to enjoy, its ramifications could have been much greater.

The comet has since become known as Lexell's Comet, after the Russian (yet Swedish born) astronomer Anders Johan Lexell who first calculated its orbit. He showed that the comet had made a close approach of just 2.2 million kilometers (0.015 AU), which is about six times the distance to the moon. It was the closest a comet has ever been witnessed to approach the Earth and, in astronomical terms, a very near (and fortunate) miss.

ANALYSIS: Nuking Asteroids: It's a Megaton Of Fun!
Lexell found that the comet swooped around the sun with an orbital period of just under six years, but its next return in 1776 would see it on the far side of the sun, out of harm's way. Sure enough, no astronomers found it again that year. In 1782 however, when again it was predicted to be visible, the comet was nowhere in sight.

The French mathematician Pierre Simon-Laplace calculated that the comet had experienced a set of encounters with the giant planet Jupiter. The first saw Jupiter's gravity modify the comet's orbit to fling it almost onto a direct collision course with Earth. The second encounter modified the comet's orbit, ejecting it from the solar system altogether and removing it as a potential hazard.

Lexell is now a lost comet and Jupiter is the reason why nobody had ever seen it before 1770, and why no one ever saw it afterwards. In doing so, Jupiter played the role of both Earth's friend and Earth's foe.

The story of Lexell's Comet was pretty much forgotten in the decades and centuries that followed. By the 1960s astronomers looked upon long period comets -- comets that hail from the Oort Cloud at the very edge of our solar system and which take many millennia to orbit the sun -- as the major impact hazard to Earth.

A general idea developed, bolstered by computer simulations performed in 1994 by the late George Wetherill of the Carnegie Institution, that dictated how Jupiter acted as Earth's protector, sweeping up or ejecting many of the long period comets from the solar system and removing them from the population of potential impactors (Wetherill's simulations coincided with comet ShoemakerLevy 9 colliding with Jupiter). This idea has taken hold in established theory yet few have ever really questioned it until now.

SLIDE SHOW: Top 10 Ways to Stop an Asteroid

Realizing that today we know of many more short period comets and near-Earth asteroids that cross our planet's orbit than long period comets, Jonathan Horner of the University of New South Wales, Sydney and Barrie Jones of the UK's Open University have run new simulations that reveal a very different picture, one that has important consequences for the habitability of Earth and planets in general.

"When George Wetherill did his work back in 1994, the computers available to him were much more limited than what we have today," says Horner, who originally comes from the U.K. "The lack of computing power meant that he had to make some fairly big approximations and simplifications. His was a ground-breaking study but at the same time it was one that was limited by what he had available."

Horner and Jones decided to run the experiment again but this time with twenty-first century computing power, hooking up tens of computers in parallel at the Open University. Their simulations agreed that Jupiter is a factor in protecting Earth from long period comets, but how would it fare with the new populations of short period comets and near Earth asteroids? Described in a series of papers published in the International Journal of Astrobiology, the duo found their answer to be at odds with conventional theory.

WATCH VIDEO: DOOMSDAY ASTEROIDS

Gravitational Resonances

Movies such as Armageddon and Deep Impact, combined with the common consensus that an asteroid strike 65 million years ago finished off the reign of the dinosaurs, has meant that the notion of asteroids hitting Earth is now part of our pop culture. These objects hail from the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter.

While most asteroids move on stable orbits around the sun, neighboring Jupiter's influence looms large and gravitational resonances between the planet and regions of the Asteroid Belt are adept at clearing out any rogue asteroids in these regions and sending them hurtling in-system. Often these rogues can originate from collisions between asteroids that send a shower of rocky chunks spinning off into these resonant zones.

"The main thing that is driving material from the Asteroid Belt into the inner solar system is the influence of something called a secular resonance," says Horner. "As things stand now in our solar system, this particular secular resonance is right at the inner edge of the asteroid belt."

In their simulations Horner and Jones played about with the mass of Jupiter, finding that the lower the planet's mass, the broader the secular resonance becomes and the more it moves into the main body of the Asteroid Belt, closer to Jupiter, leading to more asteroids being perturbed.

ANALYSIS: Violent History Preserved in Hayabusa's Asteroid Grains

The simulations showed that the number of asteroid impacts on Earth peaks when there is a planet in Jupiter's orbit that has a mass one-fifth that of Jupiter's mass, whereas just over half the peak rate of impacts occur when there is a planet with a mass equal to Jupiter. The impact rate falls off again at the lower extreme, when Jupiter's mass becomes too low to be able to nudge any asteroids with its gravity.

A similar result, albeit for different reasons, arises when considering the impact rate of short period comets on Earth. Currently, Jupiter's gravity is capable of throwing comets close to the Earth, as we saw with Lexell's Comet, but it is also equally adept at cleaning up its mess and removing dangerous comets from the solar system.

Were Jupiter only to have one-fifth of its real mass, the balance between hurling comets towards us and then removing them would be lost; Jupiter would still be able to destabilize comets and send them our way, but it would lose the ability to remove many of them.

"If you have a low mass Jupiter, it is capable of placing things on Earth-crossing orbits but because it doesn't have a big gravitational reach, once it has put a comet on an Earth-crossing orbit the comet can remain in that orbit for a very long time before it encounters Jupiter again," says Horner.

Better The Devil You Know?

Jupiter's role seems confused. It definitely sends asteroids and comets our way and, in any given year, more than 90 percent of all objects crossing Earth's orbit are asteroids, so the protection Jupiter provides us from long period comets, or by eventually removing short period comets, is of lesser importance. Hence Jupiter is not the friend that it has been perceived to be.

However, things could be far worse: were Jupiter to have a mere 20 percent of its mass, the impact rate would skyrocket. Obviously for any denizens on a planet in the target zone this is bad news, but in the grand scheme of things are impacts a positive or negative factor on the overall evolution of life on a planet across billions of years? When searching for potentially habitable exoplanets, should we seek to avoid systems that contain a 0.2 Jupiter-mass gas giant at a similar distance to Jupiter from the sun?

Whether impacts have been a good thing or a bad thing for the evolution of life on Earth depends on who you talk to, says Dave Waltham, Head of the Earth Sciences Department at Royal Holloway, University of London. "What you can definitely say is that they cause some mass extinctions. Lots of people argue, however, that impacts can be good because they stir thing up and stop the biosphere from becoming stuck in a rut. Certainly for human beings, we wouldn't be here if the dinosaurs hadn't been wiped out."

The Star of Bethlehem: Was it Jupiter?

Impacts may only be healthy in the long run if they are not so frequent as to not give the biosphere chance to recover. Evidence in Earth's geological record suggests that it takes around ten million years following a big impact for the planet to heal, so an impact rate of one large collision every hundred million years or so, as Earth experiences, allows plenty of time between crashes for life to flourish. On the other hand if that impact rate was every few million years, the bombardment would pulverize our planet into a lifeless husk with little opportunity to develop a new biosphere.

Horner and Jones' simulations are now beginning to feed into discussions regarding habitability on planets around other stars. "In Peter Ward and Donald Brownlee's book Rare Earth, they set Jupiter up as a shield, but they didn't really demonstrate it," says Waltham, a self-confessed 'Rare Earther'. "Jonti (Jonathan Horner) and Barrie went out and tested that idea and in doing so removed one of the barriers to habitability."

Too Much Water?

Impacts have an additional benefit: they bring water to otherwise dry worlds. Our current understanding of how planets form is that Earth was born dry -- temperatures were so hot that its surface was molten and any resident water was driven off. So why do we now live on a world that is replete in watery oceans?

The idea is that the water was brought here by objects that crashed into Earth, which were either asteroids or comets (the current consensus is leaning towards asteroids, based upon the discovery that the isotopes of hydrogen in Earth's water do not match the isotopes of hydrogen seen in comets). One can imagine that in an environment with too few impacts Earth would have remained as dry as the moon, and so a perturbing body like Jupiter might therefore be needed to ensure there is water present for life. On the flip-side, too many impacts could easily bring too much water.

"Earth's water is ample and there is a lot more than we would expect given where Earth formed, but you could imagine a scenario where you have a hundred or a thousand times more water and there is no solid land," says Horner.

The prospects for habitability on water worlds may be surprisingly dire, adds Waltham. "Having too much water could be a problem because Earth's climate system is, to a considerable extent, controlled by the fact that we have a mix of land and sea," he says, referring to the carbon-silicate cycle, the process by which carbon and hence global warming and atmospheric temperatures are regulated. Volcanoes spew carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which helps warm the planet, and when the climate grows too warm rain levels increase and the carbon dioxide is washed out in a slightly acidic precipitation that weathers rocks on the surface, creating calcium carbonate, bicarbonate and silica that runs-off into the oceans. Here it becomes incorporated into sea-dwelling micro-organisms that die and carry the carbon down to the sea floor, where it enters subduction zones and is eventually recycled and spewed out once more from volcanoes. Without land, the silicate weathering cannot take place, causing a fatal break in the chain.

Whereas Waltham believes Earth-like planets are rare, Horner is more the optimist and recognizes that his work with Barrie Jones has removed one of the obstacles to long-term habitability and may help act as a pointer in where to search for life in the Universe. "We'll soon go from the stage of knowing no other planets like Earth to knowing hundreds of them, and people want to look for life," he says.

"The problem is it is very difficult and time-consuming to search, so you'll only be able to look at one or two and you need to have some way of saying which are the best and worst prospects. I don't think it will be a clear cut 'this will be habitable, this won't be habitable', I think it will be 'this is a bit more habitable, this is a bit less habitable' and impacts are certainly one of the important factors."

From alien life to human life, impacts have a large influence. In the knowledge that Jupiter is far from being our savior and that the asteroid that finished off the dinosaurs may not merely have been one that slipped through the net, programs such as NASA's Spaceguard survey that seek out potentially hazardous objects are all the more vital. We must thank impacts for bringing water to Earth and paving the way for humans to evolve, but we must also never, ever stop watching the skies.

Whilst most famous for his catalog of 110 galaxies, nebulae, clusters and double stars, Charles Messier was a comet-hunter at heart. His catalog was simply a list of nuisances, faint fuzzies that looked like comets but were not.

The Frenchman found 13 comets in all between 1760 and 1785, but perhaps the most important of them was the streaking comet that he spotted in June 1770. Fast moving on the sky, it was bright enough at magnitude +2 that it could be clearly seen from well-lit towns and cities. A brief spectacle of wonder for eighteenth century astronomers to enjoy, its ramifications could have been much greater.

The comet has since become known as Lexell's Comet, after the Russian (yet Swedish born) astronomer Anders Johan Lexell who first calculated its orbit. He showed that the comet had made a close approach of just 2.2 million kilometers (0.015 AU), which is about six times the distance to the moon. It was the closest a comet has ever been witnessed to approach the Earth and, in astronomical terms, a very near (and fortunate) miss.

ANALYSIS: Nuking Asteroids: It's a Megaton Of Fun!
Lexell found that the comet swooped around the sun with an orbital period of just under six years, but its next return in 1776 would see it on the far side of the sun, out of harm's way. Sure enough, no astronomers found it again that year. In 1782 however, when again it was predicted to be visible, the comet was nowhere in sight.

The French mathematician Pierre Simon-Laplace calculated that the comet had experienced a set of encounters with the giant planet Jupiter. The first saw Jupiter's gravity modify the comet's orbit to fling it almost onto a direct collision course with Earth. The second encounter modified the comet's orbit, ejecting it from the solar system altogether and removing it as a potential hazard.

Lexell is now a lost comet and Jupiter is the reason why nobody had ever seen it before 1770, and why no one ever saw it afterwards. In doing so, Jupiter played the role of both Earth's friend and Earth's foe.

The story of Lexell's Comet was pretty much forgotten in the decades and centuries that followed. By the 1960s astronomers looked upon long period comets -- comets that hail from the Oort Cloud at the very edge of our solar system and which take many millennia to orbit the sun -- as the major impact hazard to Earth.

A general idea developed, bolstered by computer simulations performed in 1994 by the late George Wetherill of the Carnegie Institution, that dictated how Jupiter acted as Earth's protector, sweeping up or ejecting many of the long period comets from the solar system and removing them from the population of potential impactors (Wetherill's simulations coincided with comet ShoemakerLevy 9 colliding with Jupiter). This idea has taken hold in established theory yet few have ever really questioned it until now.

SLIDE SHOW: Top 10 Ways to Stop an Asteroid

Realizing that today we know of many more short period comets and near-Earth asteroids that cross our planet's orbit than long period comets, Jonathan Horner of the University of New South Wales, Sydney and Barrie Jones of the UK's Open University have run new simulations that reveal a very different picture, one that has important consequences for the habitability of Earth and planets in general.

"When George Wetherill did his work back in 1994, the computers available to him were much more limited than what we have today," says Horner, who originally comes from the U.K. "The lack of computing power meant that he had to make some fairly big approximations and simplifications. His was a ground-breaking study but at the same time it was one that was limited by what he had available."

Horner and Jones decided to run the experiment again but this time with twenty-first century computing power, hooking up tens of computers in parallel at the Open University. Their simulations agreed that Jupiter is a factor in protecting Earth from long period comets, but how would it fare with the new populations of short period comets and near Earth asteroids? Described in a series of papers published in the International Journal of Astrobiology, the duo found their answer to be at odds with conventional theory.

Gravitational Resonances

Movies such as Armageddon and Deep Impact, combined with the common consensus that an asteroid strike 65 million years ago finished off the reign of the dinosaurs, has meant that the notion of asteroids hitting Earth is now part of our pop culture. These objects hail from the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter.

While most asteroids move on stable orbits around the sun, neighboring Jupiter's influence looms large and gravitational resonances between the planet and regions of the Asteroid Belt are adept at clearing out any rogue asteroids in these regions and sending them hurtling in-system. Often these rogues can originate from collisions between asteroids that send a shower of rocky chunks spinning off into these resonant zones.

"The main thing that is driving material from the Asteroid Belt into the inner solar system is the influence of something called a secular resonance," says Horner. "As things stand now in our solar system, this particular secular resonance is right at the inner edge of the asteroid belt."

In their simulations Horner and Jones played about with the mass of Jupiter, finding that the lower the planet's mass, the broader the secular resonance becomes and the more it moves into the main body of the Asteroid Belt, closer to Jupiter, leading to more asteroids being perturbed.

ANALYSIS: Violent History Preserved in Hayabusa's Asteroid Grains

The simulations showed that the number of asteroid impacts on Earth peaks when there is a planet in Jupiter's orbit that has a mass one-fifth that of Jupiter's mass, whereas just over half the peak rate of impacts occur when there is a planet with a mass equal to Jupiter. The impact rate falls off again at the lower extreme, when Jupiter's mass becomes too low to be able to nudge any asteroids with its gravity.

A similar result, albeit for different reasons, arises when considering the impact rate of short period comets on Earth. Currently, Jupiter's gravity is capable of throwing comets close to the Earth, as we saw with Lexell's Comet, but it is also equally adept at cleaning up its mess and removing dangerous comets from the solar system.

Were Jupiter only to have one-fifth of its real mass, the balance between hurling comets towards us and then removing them would be lost; Jupiter would still be able to destabilize comets and send them our way, but it would lose the ability to remove many of them.

"If you have a low mass Jupiter, it is capable of placing things on Earth-crossing orbits but because it doesn't have a big gravitational reach, once it has put a comet on an Earth-crossing orbit the comet can remain in that orbit for a very long time before it encounters Jupiter again," says Horner.

Better The Devil You Know?

Jupiter's role seems confused. It definitely sends asteroids and comets our way and, in any given year, more than 90 percent of all objects crossing Earth's orbit are asteroids, so the protection Jupiter provides us from long period comets, or by eventually removing short period comets, is of lesser importance. Hence Jupiter is not the friend that it has been perceived to be.

However, things could be far worse: were Jupiter to have a mere 20 percent of its mass, the impact rate would skyrocket. Obviously for any denizens on a planet in the target zone this is bad news, but in the grand scheme of things are impacts a positive or negative factor on the overall evolution of life on a planet across billions of years? When searching for potentially habitable exoplanets, should we seek to avoid systems that contain a 0.2 Jupiter-mass gas giant at a similar distance to Jupiter from the sun?

Whether impacts have been a good thing or a bad thing for the evolution of life on Earth depends on who you talk to, says Dave Waltham, Head of the Earth Sciences Department at Royal Holloway, University of London. "What you can definitely say is that they cause some mass extinctions. Lots of people argue, however, that impacts can be good because they stir thing up and stop the biosphere from becoming stuck in a rut. Certainly for human beings, we wouldn't be here if the dinosaurs hadn't been wiped out."

The Star of Bethlehem: Was it Jupiter?

Impacts may only be healthy in the long run if they are not so frequent as to not give the biosphere chance to recover. Evidence in Earth's geological record suggests that it takes around ten million years following a big impact for the planet to heal, so an impact rate of one large collision every hundred million years or so, as Earth experiences, allows plenty of time between crashes for life to flourish. On the other hand if that impact rate was every few million years, the bombardment would pulverize our planet into a lifeless husk with little opportunity to develop a new biosphere.

Horner and Jones' simulations are now beginning to feed into discussions regarding habitability on planets around other stars. "In Peter Ward and Donald Brownlee's book Rare Earth, they set Jupiter up as a shield, but they didn't really demonstrate it," says Waltham, a self-confessed 'Rare Earther'. "Jonti (Jonathan Horner) and Barrie went out and tested that idea and in doing so removed one of the barriers to habitability."

Too Much Water?

Impacts have an additional benefit: they bring water to otherwise dry worlds. Our current understanding of how planets form is that Earth was born dry -- temperatures were so hot that its surface was molten and any resident water was driven off. So why do we now live on a world that is replete in watery oceans?

The idea is that the water was brought here by objects that crashed into Earth, which were either asteroids or comets (the current consensus is leaning towards asteroids, based upon the discovery that the isotopes of hydrogen in Earth's water do not match the isotopes of hydrogen seen in comets). One can imagine that in an environment with too few impacts Earth would have remained as dry as the moon, and so a perturbing body like Jupiter might therefore be needed to ensure there is water present for life. On the flip-side, too many impacts could easily bring too much water.

"Earth's water is ample and there is a lot more than we would expect given where Earth formed, but you could imagine a scenario where you have a hundred or a thousand times more water and there is no solid land," says Horner.

The prospects for habitability on water worlds may be surprisingly dire, adds Waltham. "Having too much water could be a problem because Earth's climate system is, to a considerable extent, controlled by the fact that we have a mix of land and sea," he says, referring to the carbon-silicate cycle, the process by which carbon and hence global warming and atmospheric temperatures are regulated. Volcanoes spew carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which helps warm the planet, and when the climate grows too warm rain levels increase and the carbon dioxide is washed out in a slightly acidic precipitation that weathers rocks on the surface, creating calcium carbonate, bicarbonate and silica that runs-off into the oceans. Here it becomes incorporated into sea-dwelling micro-organisms that die and carry the carbon down to the sea floor, where it enters subduction zones and is eventually recycled and spewed out once more from volcanoes. Without land, the silicate weathering cannot take place, causing a fatal break in the chain.

Whereas Waltham believes Earth-like planets are rare, Horner is more the optimist and recognizes that his work with Barrie Jones has removed one of the obstacles to long-term habitability and may help act as a pointer in where to search for life in the Universe. "We'll soon go from the stage of knowing no other planets like Earth to knowing hundreds of them, and people want to look for life," he says.

"The problem is it is very difficult and time-consuming to search, so you'll only be able to look at one or two and you need to have some way of saying which are the best and worst prospects. I don't think it will be a clear cut 'this will be habitable, this won't be habitable', I think it will be 'this is a bit more habitable, this is a bit less habitable' and impacts are certainly one of the important factors."

From alien life to human life, impacts have a large influence. In the knowledge that Jupiter is far from being our savior and that the asteroid that finished off the dinosaurs may not merely have been one that slipped through the net, programs such as NASA's Spaceguard survey that seek out potentially hazardous objects are all the more vital. We must thank impacts for bringing water to Earth and paving the way for humans to evolve, but we must also never, ever stop watching the skies.

Whilst most famous for his catalog of 110 galaxies, nebulae, clusters and double stars, Charles Messier was a comet-hunter at heart. His catalog was simply a list of nuisances, faint fuzzies that looked like comets but were not.

THE GIST

    * Using its gravitational dominance to 'vacuum' errant space rocks, Jupiter is often hailed as Earth's protector.
    * However, it is known that comets' orbits have been modified by Jupiter's gravity, sending them our way.

Whilst most famous for his catalog of 110 galaxies, nebulae, clusters and double stars, Charles Messier was a comet-hunter at heart. His catalog was simply a list of nuisances, faint fuzzies that looked like comets but were not.

The Frenchman found 13 comets in all between 1760 and 1785, but perhaps the most important of them was the streaking comet that he spotted in June 1770. Fast moving on the sky, it was bright enough at magnitude +2 that it could be clearly seen from well-lit towns and cities. A brief spectacle of wonder for eighteenth century astronomers to enjoy, its ramifications could have been much greater.

The comet has since become known as Lexell's Comet, after the Russian (yet Swedish born) astronomer Anders Johan Lexell who first calculated its orbit. He showed that the comet had made a close approach of just 2.2 million kilometers (0.015 AU), which is about six times the distance to the moon. It was the closest a comet has ever been witnessed to approach the Earth and, in astronomical terms, a very near (and fortunate) miss.

ANALYSIS: Nuking Asteroids: It's a Megaton Of Fun!
Lexell found that the comet swooped around the sun with an orbital period of just under six years, but its next return in 1776 would see it on the far side of the sun, out of harm's way. Sure enough, no astronomers found it again that year. In 1782 however, when again it was predicted to be visible, the comet was nowhere in sight.

The French mathematician Pierre Simon-Laplace calculated that the comet had experienced a set of encounters with the giant planet Jupiter. The first saw Jupiter's gravity modify the comet's orbit to fling it almost onto a direct collision course with Earth. The second encounter modified the comet's orbit, ejecting it from the solar system altogether and removing it as a potential hazard.

Lexell is now a lost comet and Jupiter is the reason why nobody had ever seen it before 1770, and why no one ever saw it afterwards. In doing so, Jupiter played the role of both Earth's friend and Earth's foe.

The story of Lexell's Comet was pretty much forgotten in the decades and centuries that followed. By the 1960s astronomers looked upon long period comets -- comets that hail from the Oort Cloud at the very edge of our solar system and which take many millennia to orbit the sun -- as the major impact hazard to Earth.

A general idea developed, bolstered by computer simulations performed in 1994 by the late George Wetherill of the Carnegie Institution, that dictated how Jupiter acted as Earth's protector, sweeping up or ejecting many of the long period comets from the solar system and removing them from the population of potential impactors (Wetherill's simulations coincided with comet ShoemakerLevy 9 colliding with Jupiter). This idea has taken hold in established theory yet few have ever really questioned it until now.

SLIDE SHOW: Top 10 Ways to Stop an Asteroid

Realizing that today we know of many more short period comets and near-Earth asteroids that cross our planet's orbit than long period comets, Jonathan Horner of the University of New South Wales, Sydney and Barrie Jones of the UK's Open University have run new simulations that reveal a very different picture, one that has important consequences for the habitability of Earth and planets in general.

"When George Wetherill did his work back in 1994, the computers available to him were much more limited than what we have today," says Horner, who originally comes from the U.K. "The lack of computing power meant that he had to make some fairly big approximations and simplifications. His was a ground-breaking study but at the same time it was one that was limited by what he had available."

Horner and Jones decided to run the experiment again but this time with twenty-first century computing power, hooking up tens of computers in parallel at the Open University. Their simulations agreed that Jupiter is a factor in protecting Earth from long period comets, but how would it fare with the new populations of short period comets and near Earth asteroids? Described in a series of papers published in the International Journal of Astrobiology, the duo found their answer to be at odds with conventional theory.

Gravitational Resonances

Movies such as Armageddon and Deep Impact, combined with the common consensus that an asteroid strike 65 million years ago finished off the reign of the dinosaurs, has meant that the notion of asteroids hitting Earth is now part of our pop culture. These objects hail from the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter.

While most asteroids move on stable orbits around the sun, neighboring Jupiter's influence looms large and gravitational resonances between the planet and regions of the Asteroid Belt are adept at clearing out any rogue asteroids in these regions and sending them hurtling in-system. Often these rogues can originate from collisions between asteroids that send a shower of rocky chunks spinning off into these resonant zones.

"The main thing that is driving material from the Asteroid Belt into the inner solar system is the influence of something called a secular resonance," says Horner. "As things stand now in our solar system, this particular secular resonance is right at the inner edge of the asteroid belt."

In their simulations Horner and Jones played about with the mass of Jupiter, finding that the lower the planet's mass, the broader the secular resonance becomes and the more it moves into the main body of the Asteroid Belt, closer to Jupiter, leading to more asteroids being perturbed.

ANALYSIS: Violent History Preserved in Hayabusa's Asteroid Grains

The simulations showed that the number of asteroid impacts on Earth peaks when there is a planet in Jupiter's orbit that has a mass one-fifth that of Jupiter's mass, whereas just over half the peak rate of impacts occur when there is a planet with a mass equal to Jupiter. The impact rate falls off again at the lower extreme, when Jupiter's mass becomes too low to be able to nudge any asteroids with its gravity.

A similar result, albeit for different reasons, arises when considering the impact rate of short period comets on Earth. Currently, Jupiter's gravity is capable of throwing comets close to the Earth, as we saw with Lexell's Comet, but it is also equally adept at cleaning up its mess and removing dangerous comets from the solar system.

Were Jupiter only to have one-fifth of its real mass, the balance between hurling comets towards us and then removing them would be lost; Jupiter would still be able to destabilize comets and send them our way, but it would lose the ability to remove many of them.

"If you have a low mass Jupiter, it is capable of placing things on Earth-crossing orbits but because it doesn't have a big gravitational reach, once it has put a comet on an Earth-crossing orbit the comet can remain in that orbit for a very long time before it encounters Jupiter again," says Horner.

Better The Devil You Know?

Jupiter's role seems confused. It definitely sends asteroids and comets our way and, in any given year, more than 90 percent of all objects crossing Earth's orbit are asteroids, so the protection Jupiter provides us from long period comets, or by eventually removing short period comets, is of lesser importance. Hence Jupiter is not the friend that it has been perceived to be.

However, things could be far worse: were Jupiter to have a mere 20 percent of its mass, the impact rate would skyrocket. Obviously for any denizens on a planet in the target zone this is bad news, but in the grand scheme of things are impacts a positive or negative factor on the overall evolution of life on a planet across billions of years? When searching for potentially habitable exoplanets, should we seek to avoid systems that contain a 0.2 Jupiter-mass gas giant at a similar distance to Jupiter from the sun?

Whether impacts have been a good thing or a bad thing for the evolution of life on Earth depends on who you talk to, says Dave Waltham, Head of the Earth Sciences Department at Royal Holloway, University of London. "What you can definitely say is that they cause some mass extinctions. Lots of people argue, however, that impacts can be good because they stir thing up and stop the biosphere from becoming stuck in a rut. Certainly for human beings, we wouldn't be here if the dinosaurs hadn't been wiped out."

The Star of Bethlehem: Was it Jupiter?

Impacts may only be healthy in the long run if they are not so frequent as to not give the biosphere chance to recover. Evidence in Earth's geological record suggests that it takes around ten million years following a big impact for the planet to heal, so an impact rate of one large collision every hundred million years or so, as Earth experiences, allows plenty of time between crashes for life to flourish. On the other hand if that impact rate was every few million years, the bombardment would pulverize our planet into a lifeless husk with little opportunity to develop a new biosphere.

Horner and Jones' simulations are now beginning to feed into discussions regarding habitability on planets around other stars. "In Peter Ward and Donald Brownlee's book Rare Earth, they set Jupiter up as a shield, but they didn't really demonstrate it," says Waltham, a self-confessed 'Rare Earther'. "Jonti (Jonathan Horner) and Barrie went out and tested that idea and in doing so removed one of the barriers to habitability."

Too Much Water?

Impacts have an additional benefit: they bring water to otherwise dry worlds. Our current understanding of how planets form is that Earth was born dry -- temperatures were so hot that its surface was molten and any resident water was driven off. So why do we now live on a world that is replete in watery oceans?

The idea is that the water was brought here by objects that crashed into Earth, which were either asteroids or comets (the current consensus is leaning towards asteroids, based upon the discovery that the isotopes of hydrogen in Earth's water do not match the isotopes of hydrogen seen in comets). One can imagine that in an environment with too few impacts Earth would have remained as dry as the moon, and so a perturbing body like Jupiter might therefore be needed to ensure there is water present for life. On the flip-side, too many impacts could easily bring too much water.

"Earth's water is ample and there is a lot more than we would expect given where Earth formed, but you could imagine a scenario where you have a hundred or a thousand times more water and there is no solid land," says Horner.

The prospects for habitability on water worlds may be surprisingly dire, adds Waltham. "Having too much water could be a problem because Earth's climate system is, to a considerable extent, controlled by the fact that we have a mix of land and sea," he says, referring to the carbon-silicate cycle, the process by which carbon and hence global warming and atmospheric temperatures are regulated. Volcanoes spew carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which helps warm the planet, and when the climate grows too warm rain levels increase and the carbon dioxide is washed out in a slightly acidic precipitation that weathers rocks on the surface, creating calcium carbonate, bicarbonate and silica that runs-off into the oceans. Here it becomes incorporated into sea-dwelling micro-organisms that die and carry the carbon down to the sea floor, where it enters subduction zones and is eventually recycled and spewed out once more from volcanoes. Without land, the silicate weathering cannot take place, causing a fatal break in the chain.

Whereas Waltham believes Earth-like planets are rare, Horner is more the optimist and recognizes that his work with Barrie Jones has removed one of the obstacles to long-term habitability and may help act as a pointer in where to search for life in the Universe. "We'll soon go from the stage of knowing no other planets like Earth to knowing hundreds of them, and people want to look for life," he says.

"The problem is it is very difficult and time-consuming to search, so you'll only be able to look at one or two and you need to have some way of saying which are the best and worst prospects. I don't think it will be a clear cut 'this will be habitable, this won't be habitable', I think it will be 'this is a bit more habitable, this is a bit less habitable' and impacts are certainly one of the important factors."

From alien life to human life, impacts have a large influence. In the knowledge that Jupiter is far from being our savior and that the asteroid that finished off the dinosaurs may not merely have been one that slipped through the net, programs such as NASA's Spaceguard survey that seek out potentially hazardous objects are all the more vital. We must thank impacts for bringing water to Earth and paving the way for humans to evolve, but we must also never, ever stop watching the skies.

In the knowledge that Jupiter is far from being our savior and that the asteroid that finished off the dinosaurs may not merely have been one that slipped through the net, programs such as NASA's Spaceguard survey that seek out potentially hazardous objects are all the more vital. We must thank impacts for bringing water to Earth and paving the way for humans to evolve, but we must also never, ever stop watching the skies.

THE GIST

    * Using its gravitational dominance to 'vacuum' errant space rocks, Jupiter is often hailed as Earth's protector.
    * However, it is known that comets' orbits have been modified by Jupiter's gravity, sending them our way.

Whilst most famous for his catalog of 110 galaxies, nebulae, clusters and double stars, Charles Messier was a comet-hunter at heart. His catalog was simply a list of nuisances, faint fuzzies that looked like comets but were not.

The Frenchman found 13 comets in all between 1760 and 1785, but perhaps the most important of them was the streaking comet that he spotted in June 1770. Fast moving on the sky, it was bright enough at magnitude +2 that it could be clearly seen from well-lit towns and cities. A brief spectacle of wonder for eighteenth century astronomers to enjoy, its ramifications could have been much greater.

The comet has since become known as Lexell's Comet, after the Russian (yet Swedish born) astronomer Anders Johan Lexell who first calculated its orbit. He showed that the comet had made a close approach of just 2.2 million kilometers (0.015 AU), which is about six times the distance to the moon. It was the closest a comet has ever been witnessed to approach the Earth and, in astronomical terms, a very near (and fortunate) miss.

ANALYSIS: Nuking Asteroids: It's a Megaton Of Fun!
Lexell found that the comet swooped around the sun with an orbital period of just under six years, but its next return in 1776 would see it on the far side of the sun, out of harm's way. Sure enough, no astronomers found it again that year. In 1782 however, when again it was predicted to be visible, the comet was nowhere in sight.

The French mathematician Pierre Simon-Laplace calculated that the comet had experienced a set of encounters with the giant planet Jupiter. The first saw Jupiter's gravity modify the comet's orbit to fling it almost onto a direct collision course with Earth. The second encounter modified the comet's orbit, ejecting it from the solar system altogether and removing it as a potential hazard.

Lexell is now a lost comet and Jupiter is the reason why nobody had ever seen it before 1770, and why no one ever saw it afterwards. In doing so, Jupiter played the role of both Earth's friend and Earth's foe.

The story of Lexell's Comet was pretty much forgotten in the decades and centuries that followed. By the 1960s astronomers looked upon long period comets -- comets that hail from the Oort Cloud at the very edge of our solar system and which take many millennia to orbit the sun -- as the major impact hazard to Earth.

A general idea developed, bolstered by computer simulations performed in 1994 by the late George Wetherill of the Carnegie Institution, that dictated how Jupiter acted as Earth's protector, sweeping up or ejecting many of the long period comets from the solar system and removing them from the population of potential impactors (Wetherill's simulations coincided with comet ShoemakerLevy 9 colliding with Jupiter). This idea has taken hold in established theory yet few have ever really questioned it until now.

SLIDE SHOW: Top 10 Ways to Stop an Asteroid

Realizing that today we know of many more short period comets and near-Earth asteroids that cross our planet's orbit than long period comets, Jonathan Horner of the University of New South Wales, Sydney and Barrie Jones of the UK's Open University have run new simulations that reveal a very different picture, one that has important consequences for the habitability of Earth and planets in general.

"When George Wetherill did his work back in 1994, the computers available to him were much more limited than what we have today," says Horner, who originally comes from the U.K. "The lack of computing power meant that he had to make some fairly big approximations and simplifications. His was a ground-breaking study but at the same time it was one that was limited by what he had available."

Horner and Jones decided to run the experiment again but this time with twenty-first century computing power, hooking up tens of computers in parallel at the Open University. Their simulations agreed that Jupiter is a factor in protecting Earth from long period comets, but how would it fare with the new populations of short period comets and near Earth asteroids? Described in a series of papers published in the International Journal of Astrobiology, the duo found their answer to be at odds with conventional theory.

Gravitational Resonances

Movies such as Armageddon and Deep Impact, combined with the common consensus that an asteroid strike 65 million years ago finished off the reign of the dinosaurs, has meant that the notion of asteroids hitting Earth is now part of our pop culture. These objects hail from the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter.

While most asteroids move on stable orbits around the sun, neighboring Jupiter's influence looms large and gravitational resonances between the planet and regions of the Asteroid Belt are adept at clearing out any rogue asteroids in these regions and sending them hurtling in-system. Often these rogues can originate from collisions between asteroids that send a shower of rocky chunks spinning off into these resonant zones.

"The main thing that is driving material from the Asteroid Belt into the inner solar system is the influence of something called a secular resonance," says Horner. "As things stand now in our solar system, this particular secular resonance is right at the inner edge of the asteroid belt."

In their simulations Horner and Jones played about with the mass of Jupiter, finding that the lower the planet's mass, the broader the secular resonance becomes and the more it moves into the main body of the Asteroid Belt, closer to Jupiter, leading to more asteroids being perturbed.

ANALYSIS: Violent History Preserved in Hayabusa's Asteroid Grains

The simulations showed that the number of asteroid impacts on Earth peaks when there is a planet in Jupiter's orbit that has a mass one-fifth that of Jupiter's mass, whereas just over half the peak rate of impacts occur when there is a planet with a mass equal to Jupiter. The impact rate falls off again at the lower extreme, when Jupiter's mass becomes too low to be able to nudge any asteroids with its gravity.

A similar result, albeit for different reasons, arises when considering the impact rate of short period comets on Earth. Currently, Jupiter's gravity is capable of throwing comets close to the Earth, as we saw with Lexell's Comet, but it is also equally adept at cleaning up its mess and removing dangerous comets from the solar system.

Were Jupiter only to have one-fifth of its real mass, the balance between hurling comets towards us and then removing them would be lost; Jupiter would still be able to destabilize comets and send them our way, but it would lose the ability to remove many of them.

"If you have a low mass Jupiter, it is capable of placing things on Earth-crossing orbits but because it doesn't have a big gravitational reach, once it has put a comet on an Earth-crossing orbit the comet can remain in that orbit for a very long time before it encounters Jupiter again," says Horner.

Better The Devil You Know?

Jupiter's role seems confused. It definitely sends asteroids and comets our way and, in any given year, more than 90 percent of all objects crossing Earth's orbit are asteroids, so the protection Jupiter provides us from long period comets, or by eventually removing short period comets, is of lesser importance. Hence Jupiter is not the friend that it has been perceived to be.

However, things could be far worse: were Jupiter to have a mere 20 percent of its mass, the impact rate would skyrocket. Obviously for any denizens on a planet in the target zone this is bad news, but in the grand scheme of things are impacts a positive or negative factor on the overall evolution of life on a planet across billions of years? When searching for potentially habitable exoplanets, should we seek to avoid systems that contain a 0.2 Jupiter-mass gas giant at a similar distance to Jupiter from the sun?

Whether impacts have been a good thing or a bad thing for the evolution of life on Earth depends on who you talk to, says Dave Waltham, Head of the Earth Sciences Department at Royal Holloway, University of London. "What you can definitely say is that they cause some mass extinctions. Lots of people argue, however, that impacts can be good because they stir thing up and stop the biosphere from becoming stuck in a rut. Certainly for human beings, we wouldn't be here if the dinosaurs hadn't been wiped out."

The Star of Bethlehem: Was it Jupiter?

Impacts may only be healthy in the long run if they are not so frequent as to not give the biosphere chance to recover. Evidence in Earth's geological record suggests that it takes around ten million years following a big impact for the planet to heal, so an impact rate of one large collision every hundred million years or so, as Earth experiences, allows plenty of time between crashes for life to flourish. On the other hand if that impact rate was every few million years, the bombardment would pulverize our planet into a lifeless husk with little opportunity to develop a new biosphere.

Horner and Jones' simulations are now beginning to feed into discussions regarding habitability on planets around other stars. "In Peter Ward and Donald Brownlee's book Rare Earth, they set Jupiter up as a shield, but they didn't really demonstrate it," says Waltham, a self-confessed 'Rare Earther'. "Jonti (Jonathan Horner) and Barrie went out and tested that idea and in doing so removed one of the barriers to habitability."

Too Much Water?

Impacts have an additional benefit: they bring water to otherwise dry worlds. Our current understanding of how planets form is that Earth was born dry -- temperatures were so hot that its surface was molten and any resident water was driven off. So why do we now live on a world that is replete in watery oceans?

The idea is that the water was brought here by objects that crashed into Earth, which were either asteroids or comets (the current consensus is leaning towards asteroids, based upon the discovery that the isotopes of hydrogen in Earth's water do not match the isotopes of hydrogen seen in comets). One can imagine that in an environment with too few impacts Earth would have remained as dry as the moon, and so a perturbing body like Jupiter might therefore be needed to ensure there is water present for life. On the flip-side, too many impacts could easily bring too much water.

"Earth's water is ample and there is a lot more than we would expect given where Earth formed, but you could imagine a scenario where you have a hundred or a thousand times more water and there is no solid land," says Horner.

The prospects for habitability on water worlds may be surprisingly dire, adds Waltham. "Having too much water could be a problem because Earth's climate system is, to a considerable extent, controlled by the fact that we have a mix of land and sea," he says, referring to the carbon-silicate cycle, the process by which carbon and hence global warming and atmospheric temperatures are regulated. Volcanoes spew carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which helps warm the planet, and when the climate grows too warm rain levels increase and the carbon dioxide is washed out in a slightly acidic precipitation that weathers rocks on the surface, creating calcium carbonate, bicarbonate and silica that runs-off into the oceans. Here it becomes incorporated into sea-dwelling micro-organisms that die and carry the carbon down to the sea floor, where it enters subduction zones and is eventually recycled and spewed out once more from volcanoes. Without land, the silicate weathering cannot take place, causing a fatal break in the chain.

Whereas Waltham believes Earth-like planets are rare, Horner is more the optimist and recognizes that his work with Barrie Jones has removed one of the obstacles to long-term habitability and may help act as a pointer in where to search for life in the Universe. "We'll soon go from the stage of knowing no other planets like Earth to knowing hundreds of them, and people want to look for life," he says.

"The problem is it is very difficult and time-consuming to search, so you'll only be able to look at one or two and you need to have some way of saying which are the best and worst prospects. I don't think it will be a clear cut 'this will be habitable, this won't be habitable', I think it will be 'this is a bit more habitable, this is a bit less habitable' and impacts are certainly one of the important factors."

From alien life to human life, impacts have a large influence. In the knowledge that Jupiter is far from being our savior and that the asteroid that finished off the dinosaurs may not merely have been one that slipped through the net, programs such as NASA's Spaceguard survey that seek out potentially hazardous objects are all the more vital. We must thank impacts for bringing water to Earth and paving the way for humans to evolve, but we must also never, ever stop watching the skies.

Evidence in Earth's geological record suggests that it takes around ten million years following a big impact for the planet to heal, so an impact rate of one large collision every hundred million years or so, as Earth experiences, allows plenty of time between crashes for life to flourish. On the other hand if that impact rate was every few million years, the bombardment would pulverize our planet into a lifeless husk with little opportunity to develop a new biosphere.

Horner and Jones' simulations are now beginning to feed into discussions regarding habitability on planets around other stars. "In Peter Ward and Donald Brownlee's book Rare Earth, they set Jupiter up as a shield, but they didn't really demonstrate it," says Waltham, a self-confessed 'Rare Earther'. "Jonti (Jonathan Horner) and Barrie went out and tested that idea and in doing so removed one of the barriers to habitability."

Too Much Water?

Impacts have an additional benefit: they bring water to otherwise dry worlds. Our current understanding of how planets form is that Earth was born dry -- temperatures were so hot that its surface was molten and any resident water was driven off. So why do we now live on a world that is replete in watery oceans?

The idea is that the water was brought here by objects that crashed into Earth, which were either asteroids or comets (the current consensus is leaning towards asteroids, based upon the discovery that the isotopes of hydrogen in Earth's water do not match the isotopes of hydrogen seen in comets). One can imagine that in an environment with too few impacts Earth would have remained as dry as the moon, and so a perturbing body like Jupiter might therefore be needed to ensure there is water present for life. On the flip-side, too many impacts could easily bring too much water.

"Earth's water is ample and there is a lot more than we would expect given where Earth formed, but you could imagine a scenario where you have a hundred or a thousand times more water and there is no solid land," says Horner.

The prospects for habitability on water worlds may be surprisingly dire, adds Waltham. "Having too much water could be a problem because Earth's climate system is, to a considerable extent, controlled by the fact that we have a mix of land and sea," he says, referring to the carbon-silicate cycle, the process by which carbon and hence global warming and atmospheric temperatures are regulated. Volcanoes spew carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which helps warm the planet, and when the climate grows too warm rain levels increase and the carbon dioxide is washed out in a slightly acidic precipitation that weathers rocks on the surface, creating calcium carbonate, bicarbonate and silica that runs-off into the oceans. Here it becomes incorporated into sea-dwelling micro-organisms that die and carry the carbon down to the sea floor, where it enters subduction zones and is eventually recycled and spewed out once more from volcanoes. Without land, the silicate weathering cannot take place, causing a fatal break in the chain.

Whereas Waltham believes Earth-like planets are rare, Horner is more the optimist and recognizes that his work with Barrie Jones has removed one of the obstacles to long-term habitability and may help act as a pointer in where to search for life in the Universe. "We'll soon go from the stage of knowing no other planets like Earth to knowing hundreds of them, and people want to look for life," he says.

"The problem is it is very difficult and time-consuming to search, so you'll only be able to look at one or two and you need to have some way of saying which are the best and worst prospects. I don't think it will be a clear cut 'this will be habitable, this won't be habitable', I think it will be 'this is a bit more habitable, this is a bit less habitable' and impacts are certainly one of the important factors."

From alien life to human life, impacts have a large influence. In the knowledge that Jupiter is far from being our savior and that the asteroid that finished off the dinosaurs may not merely have been one that slipped through the net, programs such as NASA's Spaceguard survey that seek out potentially hazardous objects are all the more vital. We must thank impacts for bringing water to Earth and paving the way for humans to evolve, but we must also never, ever stop watching the skies.

Whilst most famous for his catalog of 110 galaxies, nebulae, clusters and double stars, Charles Messier was a comet-hunter at heart. His catalog was simply a list of nuisances, faint fuzzies that looked like comets but were not.

The Frenchman found 13 comets in all between 1760 and 1785, but perhaps the most important of them was the streaking comet that he spotted in June 1770. Fast moving on the sky, it was bright enough at magnitude +2 that it could be clearly seen from well-lit towns and cities. A brief spectacle of wonder for eighteenth century astronomers to enjoy, its ramifications could have been much greater.

The comet has since become known as Lexell's Comet, after the Russian (yet Swedish born) astronomer Anders Johan Lexell who first calculated its orbit. He showed that the comet had made a close approach of just 2.2 million kilometers (0.015 AU), which is about six times the distance to the moon. It was the closest a comet has ever been witnessed to approach the Earth and, in astronomical terms, a very near (and fortunate) miss.

ANALYSIS: Nuking Asteroids: It's a Megaton Of Fun!
Lexell found that the comet swooped around the sun with an orbital period of just under six years, but its next return in 1776 would see it on the far side of the sun, out of harm's way. Sure enough, no astronomers found it again that year. In 1782 however, when again it was predicted to be visible, the comet was nowhere in sight.

The French mathematician Pierre Simon-Laplace calculated that the comet had experienced a set of encounters with the giant planet Jupiter. The first saw Jupiter's gravity modify the comet's orbit to fling it almost onto a direct collision course with Earth. The second encounter modified the comet's orbit, ejecting it from the solar system altogether and removing it as a potential hazard.

Lexell is now a lost comet and Jupiter is the reason why nobody had ever seen it before 1770, and why no one ever saw it afterwards. In doing so, Jupiter played the role of both Earth's friend and Earth's foe.

The story of Lexell's Comet was pretty much forgotten in the decades and centuries that followed. By the 1960s astronomers looked upon long period comets -- comets that hail from the Oort Cloud at the very edge of our solar system and which take many millennia to orbit the sun -- as the major impact hazard to Earth.

A general idea developed, bolstered by computer simulations performed in 1994 by the late George Wetherill of the Carnegie Institution, that dictated how Jupiter acted as Earth's protector, sweeping up or ejecting many of the long period comets from the solar system and removing them from the population of potential impactors (Wetherill's simulations coincided with comet ShoemakerLevy 9 colliding with Jupiter). This idea has taken hold in established theory yet few have ever really questioned it until now.

SLIDE SHOW: Top 10 Ways to Stop an Asteroid

Realizing that today we know of many more short period comets and near-Earth asteroids that cross our planet's orbit than long period comets, Jonathan Horner of the University of New South Wales, Sydney and Barrie Jones of the UK's Open University have run new simulations that reveal a very different picture, one that has important consequences for the habitability of Earth and planets in general.

"When George Wetherill did his work back in 1994, the computers available to him were much more limited than what we have today," says Horner, who originally comes from the U.K. "The lack of computing power meant that he had to make some fairly big approximations and simplifications. His was a ground-breaking study but at the same time it was one that was limited by what he had available."

Horner and Jones decided to run the experiment again but this time with twenty-first century computing power, hooking up tens of computers in parallel at the Open University. Their simulations agreed that Jupiter is a factor in protecting Earth from long period comets, but how would it fare with the new populations of short period comets and near Earth asteroids? Described in a series of papers published in the International Journal of Astrobiology, the duo found their answer to be at odds with conventional theory.

Gravitational Resonances

Movies such as Armageddon and Deep Impact, combined with the common consensus that an asteroid strike 65 million years ago finished off the reign of the dinosaurs, has meant that the notion of asteroids hitting Earth is now part of our pop culture. These objects hail from the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter.

While most asteroids move on stable orbits around the sun, neighboring Jupiter's influence looms large and gravitational resonances between the planet and regions of the Asteroid Belt are adept at clearing out any rogue asteroids in these regions and sending them hurtling in-system. Often these rogues can originate from collisions between asteroids that send a shower of rocky chunks spinning off into these resonant zones.

"The main thing that is driving material from the Asteroid Belt into the inner solar system is the influence of something called a secular resonance," says Horner. "As things stand now in our solar system, this particular secular resonance is right at the inner edge of the asteroid belt."

In their simulations Horner and Jones played about with the mass of Jupiter, finding that the lower the planet's mass, the broader the secular resonance becomes and the more it moves into the main body of the Asteroid Belt, closer to Jupiter, leading to more asteroids being perturbed.

ANALYSIS: Violent History Preserved in Hayabusa's Asteroid Grains

The simulations showed that the number of asteroid impacts on Earth peaks when there is a planet in Jupiter's orbit that has a mass one-fifth that of Jupiter's mass, whereas just over half the peak rate of impacts occur when there is a planet with a mass equal to Jupiter. The impact rate falls off again at the lower extreme, when Jupiter's mass becomes too low to be able to nudge any asteroids with its gravity.

A similar result, albeit for different reasons, arises when considering the impact rate of short period comets on Earth. Currently, Jupiter's gravity is capable of throwing comets close to the Earth, as we saw with Lexell's Comet, but it is also equally adept at cleaning up its mess and removing dangerous comets from the solar system.

Were Jupiter only to have one-fifth of its real mass, the balance between hurling comets towards us and then removing them would be lost; Jupiter would still be able to destabilize comets and send them our way, but it would lose the ability to remove many of them.

"If you have a low mass Jupiter, it is capable of placing things on Earth-crossing orbits but because it doesn't have a big gravitational reach, once it has put a comet on an Earth-crossing orbit the comet can remain in that orbit for a very long time before it encounters Jupiter again," says Horner.

Better The Devil You Know?

Jupiter's role seems confused. It definitely sends asteroids and comets our way and, in any given year, more than 90 percent of all objects crossing Earth's orbit are asteroids, so the protection Jupiter provides us from long period comets, or by eventually removing short period comets, is of lesser importance. Hence Jupiter is not the friend that it has been perceived to be.

However, things could be far worse: were Jupiter to have a mere 20 percent of its mass, the impact rate would skyrocket. Obviously for any denizens on a planet in the target zone this is bad news, but in the grand scheme of things are impacts a positive or negative factor on the overall evolution of life on a planet across billions of years? When searching for potentially habitable exoplanets, should we seek to avoid systems that contain a 0.2 Jupiter-mass gas giant at a similar distance to Jupiter from the sun?

Whether impacts have been a good thing or a bad thing for the evolution of life on Earth depends on who you talk to, says Dave Waltham, Head of the Earth Sciences Department at Royal Holloway, University of London. "What you can definitely say is that they cause some mass extinctions. Lots of people argue, however, that impacts can be good because they stir thing up and stop the biosphere from becoming stuck in a rut. Certainly for human beings, we wouldn't be here if the dinosaurs hadn't been wiped out."

The Star of Bethlehem: Was it Jupiter?

Impacts may only be healthy in the long run if they are not so frequent as to not give the biosphere chance to recover. Evidence in Earth's geological record suggests that it takes around ten million years following a big impact for the planet to heal, so an impact rate of one large collision every hundred million years or so, as Earth experiences, allows plenty of time between crashes for life to flourish. On the other hand if that impact rate was every few million years, the bombardment would pulverize our planet into a lifeless husk with little opportunity to develop a new biosphere.

Horner and Jones' simulations are now beginning to feed into discussions regarding habitability on planets around other stars. "In Peter Ward and Donald Brownlee's book Rare Earth, they set Jupiter up as a shield, but they didn't really demonstrate it," says Waltham, a self-confessed 'Rare Earther'. "Jonti (Jonathan Horner) and Barrie went out and tested that idea and in doing so removed one of the barriers to habitability."

Too Much Water?

Impacts have an additional benefit: they bring water to otherwise dry worlds. Our current understanding of how planets form is that Earth was born dry -- temperatures were so hot that its surface was molten and any resident water was driven off. So why do we now live on a world that is replete in watery oceans?

The idea is that the water was brought here by objects that crashed into Earth, which were either asteroids or comets (the current consensus is leaning towards asteroids, based upon the discovery that the isotopes of hydrogen in Earth's water do not match the isotopes of hydrogen seen in comets). One can imagine that in an environment with too few impacts Earth would have remained as dry as the moon, and so a perturbing body like Jupiter might therefore be needed to ensure there is water present for life. On the flip-side, too many impacts could easily bring too much water.

"Earth's water is ample and there is a lot more than we would expect given where Earth formed, but you could imagine a scenario where you have a hundred or a thousand times more water and there is no solid land," says Horner.

The prospects for habitability on water worlds may be surprisingly dire, adds Waltham. "Having too much water could be a problem because Earth's climate system is, to a considerable extent, controlled by the fact that we have a mix of land and sea," he says, referring to the carbon-silicate cycle, the process by which carbon and hence global warming and atmospheric temperatures are regulated. Volcanoes spew carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which helps warm the planet, and when the climate grows too warm rain levels increase and the carbon dioxide is washed out in a slightly acidic precipitation that weathers rocks on the surface, creating calcium carbonate, bicarbonate and silica that runs-off into the oceans. Here it becomes incorporated into sea-dwelling micro-organisms that die and carry the carbon down to the sea floor, where it enters subduction zones and is eventually recycled and spewed out once more from volcanoes. Without land, the silicate weathering cannot take place, causing a fatal break in the chain.

Whereas Waltham believes Earth-like planets are rare, Horner is more the optimist and recognizes that his work with Barrie Jones has removed one of the obstacles to long-term habitability and may help act as a pointer in where to search for life in the Universe. "We'll soon go from the stage of knowing no other planets like Earth to knowing hundreds of them, and people want to look for life," he says.

"The problem is it is very difficult and time-consuming to search, so you'll only be able to look at one or two and you need to have some way of saying which are the best and worst prospects. I don't think it will be a clear cut 'this will be habitable, this won't be habitable', I think it will be 'this is a bit more habitable, this is a bit less habitable' and impacts are certainly one of the important factors."

From alien life to human life, impacts have a large influence. In the knowledge that Jupiter is far from being our savior and that the asteroid that finished off the dinosaurs may not merely have been one that slipped through the net, programs such as NASA's Spaceguard survey that seek out potentially hazardous objects are all the more vital. We must thank impacts for bringing water to Earth and paving the way for humans to evolve, but we must also never, ever stop watching the skies.

"The main thing that is driving material from the Asteroid Belt into the inner solar system is the influence of something called a secular resonance," says Horner. "As things stand now in our solar system, this particular secular resonance is right at the inner edge of the asteroid belt."

In their simulations Horner and Jones played about with the mass of Jupiter, finding that the lower the planet's mass, the broader the secular resonance becomes and the more it moves into the main body of the Asteroid Belt, closer to Jupiter, leading to more asteroids being perturbed.

ANALYSIS: Violent History Preserved in Hayabusa's Asteroid Grains

The simulations showed that the number of asteroid impacts on Earth peaks when there is a planet in Jupiter's orbit that has a mass one-fifth that of Jupiter's mass, whereas just over half the peak rate of impacts occur when there is a planet with a mass equal to Jupiter. The impact rate falls off again at the lower extreme, when Jupiter's mass becomes too low to be able to nudge any asteroids with its gravity.

A similar result, albeit for different reasons, arises when considering the impact rate of short period comets on Earth. Currently, Jupiter's gravity is capable of throwing comets close to the Earth, as we saw with Lexell's Comet, but it is also equally adept at cleaning up its mess and removing dangerous comets from the solar system.

Were Jupiter only to have one-fifth of its real mass, the balance between hurling comets towards us and then removing them would be lost; Jupiter would still be able to destabilize comets and send them our way, but it would lose the ability to remove many of them.

"If you have a low mass Jupiter, it is capable of placing things on Earth-crossing orbits but because it doesn't have a big gravitational reach, once it has put a comet on an Earth-crossing orbit the comet can remain in that orbit for a very long time before it encounters Jupiter again," says Horner.

Better The Devil You Know?

Jupiter's role seems confused. It definitely sends asteroids and comets our way and, in any given year, more than 90 percent of all objects crossing Earth's orbit are asteroids, so the protection Jupiter provides us from long period comets, or by eventually removing short period comets, is of lesser importance. Hence Jupiter is not the friend that it has been perceived to be.

However, things could be far worse: were Jupiter to have a mere 20 percent of its mass, the impact rate would skyrocket. Obviously for any denizens on a planet in the target zone this is bad news, but in the grand scheme of things are impacts a positive or negative factor on the overall evolution of life on a planet across billions of years? When searching for potentially habitable exoplanets, should we seek to avoid systems that contain a 0.2 Jupiter-mass gas giant at a similar distance to Jupiter from the sun?

Whether impacts have been a good thing or a bad thing for the evolution of life on Earth depends on who you talk to, says Dave Waltham, Head of the Earth Sciences Department at Royal Holloway, University of London. "What you can definitely say is that they cause some mass extinctions. Lots of people argue, however, that impacts can be good because they stir thing up and stop the biosphere from becoming stuck in a rut. Certainly for human beings, we wouldn't be here if the dinosaurs hadn't been wiped out."

The Star of Bethlehem: Was it Jupiter?

Impacts may only be healthy in the long run if they are not so frequent as to not give the biosphere chance to recover. Evidence in Earth's geological record suggests that it takes around ten million years following a big impact for the planet to heal, so an impact rate of one large collision every hundred million years or so, as Earth experiences, allows plenty of time between crashes for life to flourish. On the other hand if that impact rate was every few million years, the bombardment would pulverize our planet into a lifeless husk with little opportunity to develop a new biosphere.

Horner and Jones' simulations are now beginning to feed into discussions regarding habitability on planets around other stars. "In Peter Ward and Donald Brownlee's book Rare Earth, they set Jupiter up as a shield, but they didn't really demonstrate it," says Waltham, a self-confessed 'Rare Earther'. "Jonti (Jonathan Horner) and Barrie went out and tested that idea and in doing so removed one of the barriers to habitability."

Too Much Water?

Impacts have an additional benefit: they bring water to otherwise dry worlds. Our current understanding of how planets form is that Earth was born dry -- temperatures were so hot that its surface was molten and any resident water was driven off. So why do we now live on a world that is replete in watery oceans?

The idea is that the water was brought here by objects that crashed into Earth, which were either asteroids or comets (the current consensus is leaning towards asteroids, based upon the discovery that the isotopes of hydrogen in Earth's water do not match the isotopes of hydrogen seen in comets). One can imagine that in an environment with too few impacts Earth would have remained as dry as the moon, and so a perturbing body like Jupiter might therefore be needed to ensure there is water present for life. On the flip-side, too many impacts could easily bring too much water.

"Earth's water is ample and there is a lot more than we would expect given where Earth formed, but you could imagine a scenario where you have a hundred or a thousand times more water and there is no solid land," says Horner.

The prospects for habitability on water worlds may be surprisingly dire, adds Waltham. "Having too much water could be a problem because Earth's climate system is, to a considerable extent, controlled by the fact that we have a mix of land and sea," he says, referring to the carbon-silicate cycle, the process by which carbon and hence global warming and atmospheric temperatures are regulated. Volcanoes spew carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which helps warm the planet, and when the climate grows too warm rain levels increase and the carbon dioxide is washed out in a slightly acidic precipitation that weathers rocks on the surface, creating calcium carbonate, bicarbonate and silica that runs-off into the oceans. Here it becomes incorporated into sea-dwelling micro-organisms that die and carry the carbon down to the sea floor, where it enters subduction zones and is eventually recycled and spewed out once more from volcanoes. Without land, the silicate weathering cannot take place, causing a fatal break in the chain.

Whereas Waltham believes Earth-like planets are rare, Horner is more the optimist and recognizes that his work with Barrie Jones has removed one of the obstacles to long-term habitability and may help act as a pointer in where to search for life in the Universe. "We'll soon go from the stage of knowing no other planets like Earth to knowing hundreds of them, and people want to look for life," he says.

"The problem is it is very difficult and time-consuming to search, so you'll only be able to look at one or two and you need to have some way of saying which are the best and worst prospects. I don't think it will be a clear cut 'this will be habitable, this won't be habitable', I think it will be 'this is a bit more habitable, this is a bit less habitable' and impacts are certainly one of the important factors."

From alien life to human life, impacts have a large influence. In the knowledge that Jupiter is far from being our savior and that the asteroid that finished off the dinosaurs may not merely have been one that slipped through the net, programs such as NASA's Spaceguard survey that seek out potentially hazardous objects are all the more vital. We must thank impacts for bringing water to Earth and paving the way for humans to evolve, but we must also never, ever stop watching the skies.

Whilst most famous for his catalog of 110 galaxies, nebulae, clusters and double stars, Charles Messier was a comet-hunter at heart. His catalog was simply a list of nuisances, faint fuzzies that looked like comets but were not.

The Frenchman found 13 comets in all between 1760 and 1785, but perhaps the most important of them was the streaking comet that he spotted in June 1770. Fast moving on the sky, it was bright enough at magnitude +2 that it could be clearly seen from well-lit towns and cities. A brief spectacle of wonder for eighteenth century astronomers to enjoy, its ramifications could have been much greater.

The comet has since become known as Lexell's Comet, after the Russian (yet Swedish born) astronomer Anders Johan Lexell who first calculated its orbit. He showed that the comet had made a close approach of just 2.2 million kilometers (0.015 AU), which is about six times the distance to the moon. It was the closest a comet has ever been witnessed to approach the Earth and, in astronomical terms, a very near (and fortunate) miss.

ANALYSIS: Nuking Asteroids: It's a Megaton Of Fun!
Lexell found that the comet swooped around the sun with an orbital period of just under six years, but its next return in 1776 would see it on the far side of the sun, out of harm's way. Sure enough, no astronomers found it again that year. In 1782 however, when again it was predicted to be visible, the comet was nowhere in sight.

The French mathematician Pierre Simon-Laplace calculated that the comet had experienced a set of encounters with the giant planet Jupiter. The first saw Jupiter's gravity modify the comet's orbit to fling it almost onto a direct collision course with Earth. The second encounter modified the comet's orbit, ejecting it from the solar system altogether and removing it as a potential hazard.

Lexell is now a lost comet and Jupiter is the reason why nobody had ever seen it before 1770, and why no one ever saw it afterwards. In doing so, Jupiter played the role of both Earth's friend and Earth's foe.

The story of Lexell's Comet was pretty much forgotten in the decades and centuries that followed. By the 1960s astronomers looked upon long period comets -- comets that hail from the Oort Cloud at the very edge of our solar system and which take many millennia to orbit the sun -- as the major impact hazard to Earth.

A general idea developed, bolstered by computer simulations performed in 1994 by the late George Wetherill of the Carnegie Institution, that dictated how Jupiter acted as Earth's protector, sweeping up or ejecting many of the long period comets from the solar system and removing them from the population of potential impactors (Wetherill's simulations coincided with comet ShoemakerLevy 9 colliding with Jupiter). This idea has taken hold in established theory yet few have ever really questioned it until now.

SLIDE SHOW: Top 10 Ways to Stop an Asteroid

Realizing that today we know of many more short period comets and near-Earth asteroids that cross our planet's orbit than long period comets, Jonathan Horner of the University of New South Wales, Sydney and Barrie Jones of the UK's Open University have run new simulations that reveal a very different picture, one that has important consequences for the habitability of Earth and planets in general.

"When George Wetherill did his work back in 1994, the computers available to him were much more limited than what we have today," says Horner, who originally comes from the U.K. "The lack of computing power meant that he had to make some fairly big approximations and simplifications. His was a ground-breaking study but at the same time it was one that was limited by what he had available."

Horner and Jones decided to run the experiment again but this time with twenty-first century computing power, hooking up tens of computers in parallel at the Open University. Their simulations agreed that Jupiter is a factor in protecting Earth from long period comets, but how would it fare with the new populations of short period comets and near Earth asteroids? Described in a series of papers published in the International Journal of Astrobiology, the duo found their answer to be at odds with conventional theory.

Gravitational Resonances

Movies such as Armageddon and Deep Impact, combined with the common consensus that an asteroid strike 65 million years ago finished off the reign of the dinosaurs, has meant that the notion of asteroids hitting Earth is now part of our pop culture. These objects hail from the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter.

While most asteroids move on stable orbits around the sun, neighboring Jupiter's influence looms large and gravitational resonances between the planet and regions of the Asteroid Belt are adept at clearing out any rogue asteroids in these regions and sending them hurtling in-system. Often these rogues can originate from collisions between asteroids that send a shower of rocky chunks spinning off into these resonant zones.

"The main thing that is driving material from the Asteroid Belt into the inner solar system is the influence of something called a secular resonance," says Horner. "As things stand now in our solar system, this particular secular resonance is right at the inner edge of the asteroid belt."

In their simulations Horner and Jones played about with the mass of Jupiter, finding that the lower the planet's mass, the broader the secular resonance becomes and the more it moves into the main body of the Asteroid Belt, closer to Jupiter, leading to more asteroids being perturbed.

The simulations showed that the number of asteroid impacts on Earth peaks when there is a planet in Jupiter's orbit that has a mass one-fifth that of Jupiter's mass, whereas just over half the peak rate of impacts occur when there is a planet with a mass equal to Jupiter. The impact rate falls off again at the lower extreme, when Jupiter's mass becomes too low to be able to nudge any asteroids with its gravity.

A similar result, albeit for different reasons, arises when considering the impact rate of short period comets on Earth. Currently, Jupiter's gravity is capable of throwing comets close to the Earth, as we saw with Lexell's Comet, but it is also equally adept at cleaning up its mess and removing dangerous comets from the solar system.

"What you can definitely say is that they cause some mass extinctions. Lots of people argue, however, that impacts can be good because they stir thing up and stop the biosphere from becoming stuck in a rut. Certainly for human beings, we wouldn't be here if the dinosaurs hadn't been wiped out."

Lexell found that the comet swooped around the sun with an orbital period of just under six years, but its next return in 1776 would see it on the far side of the sun, out of harm's way. Sure enough, no astronomers found it again that year. In 1782 however, when again it was predicted to be visible, the comet was nowhere in sight.

The French mathematician Pierre Simon-Laplace calculated that the comet had experienced a set of encounters with the giant planet Jupiter. The first saw Jupiter's gravity modify the comet's orbit to fling it almost onto a direct collision course with Earth. The second encounter modified the comet's orbit, ejecting it from the solar system altogether and removing it as a potential hazard.

Lexell is now a lost comet and Jupiter is the reason why nobody had ever seen it before 1770, and why no one ever saw it afterwards. In doing so, Jupiter played the role of both Earth's friend and Earth's foe.

The story of Lexell's Comet was pretty much forgotten in the decades and centuries that followed. By the 1960s astronomers looked upon long period comets -- comets that hail from the Oort Cloud at the very edge of our solar system and which take many millennia to orbit the sun -- as the major impact hazard to Earth.

A general idea developed, bolstered by computer simulations performed in 1994 by the late George Wetherill of the Carnegie Institution, that dictated how Jupiter acted as Earth's protector, sweeping up or ejecting many of the long period comets from the solar system and removing them from the population of potential impactors (Wetherill's simulations coincided with comet ShoemakerLevy 9 colliding with Jupiter). This idea has taken hold in established theory yet few have ever really questioned it until now.

SLIDE SHOW: Top 10 Ways to Stop an Asteroid

Realizing that today we know of many more short period comets and near-Earth asteroids that cross our planet's orbit than long period comets, Jonathan Horner of the University of New South Wales, Sydney and Barrie Jones of the UK's Open University have run new simulations that reveal a very different picture, one that has important consequences for the habitability of Earth and planets in general.

"When George Wetherill did his work back in 1994, the computers available to him were much more limited than what we have today," says Horner, who originally comes from the U.K. "The lack of computing power meant that he had to make some fairly big approximations and simplifications. His was a ground-breaking study but at the same time it was one that was limited by what he had available."

Horner and Jones decided to run the experiment again but this time with twenty-first century computing power, hooking up tens of computers in parallel at the Open University. Their simulations agreed that Jupiter is a factor in protecting Earth from long period comets, but how would it fare with the new populations of short period comets and near Earth asteroids? Described in a series of papers published in the International Journal of Astrobiology, the duo found their answer to be at odds with conventional theory.

Gravitational Resonances

Movies such as Armageddon and Deep Impact, combined with the common consensus that an asteroid strike 65 million years ago finished off the reign of the dinosaurs, has meant that the notion of asteroids hitting Earth is now part of our pop culture. These objects hail from the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter.

While most asteroids move on stable orbits around the sun, neighboring Jupiter's influence looms large and gravitational resonances between the planet and regions of the Asteroid Belt are adept at clearing out any rogue asteroids in these regions and sending them hurtling in-system. Often these rogues can originate from collisions between asteroids that send a shower of rocky chunks spinning off into these resonant zones.

"The main thing that is driving material from the Asteroid Belt into the inner solar system is the influence of something called a secular resonance," says Horner. "As things stand now in our solar system, this particular secular resonance is right at the inner edge of the asteroid belt."

In their simulations Horner and Jones played about with the mass of Jupiter, finding that the lower the planet's mass, the broader the secular resonance becomes and the more it moves into the main body of the Asteroid Belt, closer to Jupiter, leading to more asteroids being perturbed.

ANALYSIS: Violent History Preserved in Hayabusa's Asteroid Grains

The simulations showed that the number of asteroid impacts on Earth peaks when there is a planet in Jupiter's orbit that has a mass one-fifth that of Jupiter's mass, whereas just over half the peak rate of impacts occur when there is a planet with a mass equal to Jupiter. The impact rate falls off again at the lower extreme, when Jupiter's mass becomes too low to be able to nudge any asteroids with its gravity.

A similar result, albeit for different reasons, arises when considering the impact rate of short period comets on Earth. Currently, Jupiter's gravity is capable of throwing comets close to the Earth, as we saw with Lexell's Comet, but it is also equally adept at cleaning up its mess and removing dangerous comets from the solar system.

Were Jupiter only to have one-fifth of its real mass, the balance between hurling comets towards us and then removing them would be lost; Jupiter would still be able to destabilize comets and send them our way, but it would lose the ability to remove many of them.

"If you have a low mass Jupiter, it is capable of placing things on Earth-crossing orbits but because it doesn't have a big gravitational reach, once it has put a comet on an Earth-crossing orbit the comet can remain in that orbit for a very long time before it encounters Jupiter again," says Horner.

Better The Devil You Know?

Jupiter's role seems confused. It definitely sends asteroids and comets our way and, in any given year, more than 90 percent of all objects crossing Earth's orbit are asteroids, so the protection Jupiter provides us from long period comets, or by eventually removing short period comets, is of lesser importance. Hence Jupiter is not the friend that it has been perceived to be.

However, things could be far worse: were Jupiter to have a mere 20 percent of its mass, the impact rate would skyrocket. Obviously for any denizens on a planet in the target zone this is bad news, but in the grand scheme of things are impacts a positive or negative factor on the overall evolution of life on a planet across billions of years? When searching for potentially habitable exoplanets, should we seek to avoid systems that contain a 0.2 Jupiter-mass gas giant at a similar distance to Jupiter from the sun?

Whether impacts have been a good thing or a bad thing for the evolution of life on Earth depends on who you talk to, says Dave Waltham, Head of the Earth Sciences Department at Royal Holloway, University of London. "What you can definitely say is that they cause some mass extinctions. Lots of people argue, however, that impacts can be good because they stir thing up and stop the biosphere from becoming stuck in a rut. Certainly for human beings, we wouldn't be here if the dinosaurs hadn't been wiped out."

The Star of Bethlehem: Was it Jupiter?

Impacts may only be healthy in the long run if they are not so frequent as to not give the biosphere chance to recover. Evidence in Earth's geological record suggests that it takes around ten million years following a big impact for the planet to heal, so an impact rate of one large collision every hundred million years or so, as Earth experiences, allows plenty of time between crashes for life to flourish. On the other hand if that impact rate was every few million years, the bombardment would pulverize our planet into a lifeless husk with little opportunity to develop a new biosphere.

Horner and Jones' simulations are now beginning to feed into discussions regarding habitability on planets around other stars. "In Peter Ward and Donald Brownlee's book Rare Earth, they set Jupiter up as a shield, but they didn't really demonstrate it," says Waltham, a self-confessed 'Rare Earther'. "Jonti (Jonathan Horner) and Barrie went out and tested that idea and in doing so removed one of the barriers to habitability."

Too Much Water?

Impacts have an additional benefit: they bring water to otherwise dry worlds. Our current understanding of how planets form is that Earth was born dry -- temperatures were so hot that its surface was molten and any resident water was driven off. So why do we now live on a world that is replete in watery oceans?

The idea is that the water was brought here by objects that crashed into Earth, which were either asteroids or comets (the current consensus is leaning towards asteroids, based upon the discovery that the isotopes of hydrogen in Earth's water do not match the isotopes of hydrogen seen in comets). One can imagine that in an environment with too few impacts Earth would have remained as dry as the moon, and so a perturbing body like Jupiter might therefore be needed to ensure there is water present for life. On the flip-side, too many impacts could easily bring too much water.

"Earth's water is ample and there is a lot more than we would expect given where Earth formed, but you could imagine a scenario where you have a hundred or a thousand times more water and there is no solid land," says Horner.

The prospects for habitability on water worlds may be surprisingly dire, adds Waltham. "Having too much water could be a problem because Earth's climate system is, to a considerable extent, controlled by the fact that we have a mix of land and sea," he says, referring to the carbon-silicate cycle, the process by which carbon and hence global warming and atmospheric temperatures are regulated. Volcanoes spew carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which helps warm the planet, and when the climate grows too warm rain levels increase and the carbon dioxide is washed out in a slightly acidic precipitation that weathers rocks on the surface, creating calcium carbonate, bicarbonate and silica that runs-off into the oceans. Here it becomes incorporated into sea-dwelling micro-organisms that die and carry the carbon down to the sea floor, where it enters subduction zones and is eventually recycled and spewed out once more from volcanoes. Without land, the silicate weathering cannot take place, causing a fatal break in the chain.

Whereas Waltham believes Earth-like planets are rare, Horner is more the optimist and recognizes that his work with Barrie Jones has removed one of the obstacles to long-term habitability and may help act as a pointer in where to search for life in the Universe. "We'll soon go from the stage of knowing no other planets like Earth to knowing hundreds of them, and people want to look for life," he says.

"The problem is it is very difficult and time-consuming to search, so you'll only be able to look at one or two and you need to have some way of saying which are the best and worst prospects. I don't think it will be a clear cut 'this will be habitable, this won't be habitable', I think it will be 'this is a bit more habitable, this is a bit less habitable' and impacts are certainly one of the important factors."

From alien life to human life, impacts have a large influence. In the knowledge that Jupiter is far from being our savior and that the asteroid that finished off the dinosaurs may not merely have been one that slipped through the net, programs such as NASA's Spaceguard survey that seek out potentially hazardous objects are all the more vital. We must thank impacts for bringing water to Earth and paving the way for humans to evolve, but we must also never, ever stop watching the skies.

THE GIST

    * Using its gravitational dominance to 'vacuum' errant space rocks, Jupiter is often hailed as Earth's protector.
    * However, it is known that comets' orbits have been modified by Jupiter's gravity, sending them our way.

Whilst most famous for his catalog of 110 galaxies, nebulae, clusters and double stars, Charles Messier was a comet-hunter at heart. His catalog was simply a list of nuisances, faint fuzzies that looked like comets but were not.

The Frenchman found 13 comets in all between 1760 and 1785, but perhaps the most important of them was the streaking comet that he spotted in June 1770. Fast moving on the sky, it was bright enough at magnitude +2 that it could be clearly seen from well-lit towns and cities. A brief spectacle of wonder for eighteenth century astronomers to enjoy, its ramifications could have been much greater.

The comet has since become known as Lexell's Comet, after the Russian (yet Swedish born) astronomer Anders Johan Lexell who first calculated its orbit. He showed that the comet had made a close approach of just 2.2 million kilometers (0.015 AU), which is about six times the distance to the moon. It was the closest a comet has ever been witnessed to approach the Earth and, in astronomical terms, a very near (and fortunate) miss.

ANALYSIS: Nuking Asteroids: It's a Megaton Of Fun!
Lexell found that the comet swooped around the sun with an orbital period of just under six years, but its next return in 1776 would see it on the far side of the sun, out of harm's way. Sure enough, no astronomers found it again that year. In 1782 however, when again it was predicted to be visible, the comet was nowhere in sight.

The French mathematician Pierre Simon-Laplace calculated that the comet had experienced a set of encounters with the giant planet Jupiter. The first saw Jupiter's gravity modify the comet's orbit to fling it almost onto a direct collision course with Earth. The second encounter modified the comet's orbit, ejecting it from the solar system altogether and removing it as a potential hazard.

Lexell is now a lost comet and Jupiter is the reason why nobody had ever seen it before 1770, and why no one ever saw it afterwards. In doing so, Jupiter played the role of both Earth's friend and Earth's foe.

The story of Lexell's Comet was pretty much forgotten in the decades and centuries that followed. By the 1960s astronomers looked upon long period comets -- comets that hail from the Oort Cloud at the very edge of our solar system and which take many millennia to orbit the sun -- as the major impact hazard to Earth.

THE GIST

    * Using its gravitational dominance to 'vacuum' errant space rocks, Jupiter is often hailed as Earth's protector.
    * However, it is known that comets' orbits have been modified by Jupiter's gravity, sending them our way.

Whilst most famous for his catalog of 110 galaxies, nebulae, clusters and double stars, Charles Messier was a comet-hunter at heart. His catalog was simply a list of nuisances, faint fuzzies that looked like comets but were not.

The Frenchman found 13 comets in all between 1760 and 1785, but perhaps the most important of them was the streaking comet that he spotted in June 1770. Fast moving on the sky, it was bright enough at magnitude +2 that it could be clearly seen from well-lit towns and cities. A brief spectacle of wonder for eighteenth century astronomers to enjoy, its ramifications could have been much greater.

The comet has since become known as Lexell's Comet, after the Russian (yet Swedish born) astronomer Anders Johan Lexell who first calculated its orbit. He showed that the comet had made a close approach of just 2.2 million kilometers (0.015 AU), which is about six times the distance to the moon. It was the closest a comet has ever been witnessed to approach the Earth and, in astronomical terms, a very near (and fortunate) miss.

ANALYSIS: Nuking Asteroids: It's a Megaton Of Fun!
Lexell found that the comet swooped around the sun with an orbital period of just under six years, but its next return in 1776 would see it on the far side of the sun, out of harm's way. Sure enough, no astronomers found it again that year. In 1782 however, when again it was predicted to be visible, the comet was nowhere in sight.

The French mathematician Pierre Simon-Laplace calculated that the comet had experienced a set of encounters with the giant planet Jupiter. The first saw Jupiter's gravity modify the comet's orbit to fling it almost onto a direct collision course with Earth. The second encounter modified the comet's orbit, ejecting it from the solar system altogether and removing it as a potential hazard.

Lexell is now a lost comet and Jupiter is the reason why nobody had ever seen it before 1770, and why no one ever saw it afterwards. In doing so, Jupiter played the role of both Earth's friend and Earth's foe.

The story of Lexell's Comet was pretty much forgotten in the decades and centuries that followed. By the 1960s astronomers looked upon long period comets -- comets that hail from the Oort Cloud at the very edge of our solar system and which take many millennia to orbit the sun -- as the major impact hazard to Earth.

A general idea developed, bolstered by computer simulations performed in 1994 by the late George Wetherill of the Carnegie Institution, that dictated how Jupiter acted as Earth's protector, sweeping up or ejecting many of the long period comets from the solar system and removing them from the population of potential impactors (Wetherill's simulations coincided with comet ShoemakerLevy 9 colliding with Jupiter). This idea has taken hold in established theory yet few have ever really questioned it until now.

SLIDE SHOW: Top 10 Ways to Stop an Asteroid

Realizing that today we know of many more short period comets and near-Earth asteroids that cross our planet's orbit than long period comets, Jonathan Horner of the University of New South Wales, Sydney and Barrie Jones of the UK's Open University have run new simulations that reveal a very different picture, one that has important consequences for the habitability of Earth and planets in general.

"When George Wetherill did his work back in 1994, the computers available to him were much more limited than what we have today," says Horner, who originally comes from the U.K. "The lack of computing power meant that he had to make some fairly big approximations and simplifications. His was a ground-breaking study but at the same time it was one that was limited by what he had available."

Horner and Jones decided to run the experiment again but this time with twenty-first century computing power, hooking up tens of computers in parallel at the Open University. Their simulations agreed that Jupiter is a factor in protecting Earth from long period comets, but how would it fare with the new populations of short period comets and near Earth asteroids? Described in a series of papers published in the International Journal of Astrobiology, the duo found their answer to be at odds with conventional theory.

Gravitational Resonances

Movies such as Armageddon and Deep Impact, combined with the common consensus that an asteroid strike 65 million years ago finished off the reign of the dinosaurs, has meant that the notion of asteroids hitting Earth is now part of our pop culture. These objects hail from the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter.

While most asteroids move on stable orbits around the sun, neighboring Jupiter's influence looms large and gravitational resonances between the planet and regions of the Asteroid Belt are adept at clearing out any rogue asteroids in these regions and sending them hurtling in-system. Often these rogues can originate from collisions between asteroids that send a shower of rocky chunks spinning off into these resonant zones.

"The main thing that is driving material from the Asteroid Belt into the inner solar system is the influence of something called a secular resonance," says Horner. "As things stand now in our solar system, this particular secular resonance is right at the inner edge of the asteroid belt."

In their simulations Horner and Jones played about with the mass of Jupiter, finding that the lower the planet's mass, the broader the secular resonance becomes and the more it moves into the main body of the Asteroid Belt, closer to Jupiter, leading to more asteroids being perturbed.

ANALYSIS: Violent History Preserved in Hayabusa's Asteroid Grains

The simulations showed that the number of asteroid impacts on Earth peaks when there is a planet in Jupiter's orbit that has a mass one-fifth that of Jupiter's mass, whereas just over half the peak rate of impacts occur when there is a planet with a mass equal to Jupiter. The impact rate falls off again at the lower extreme, when Jupiter's mass becomes too low to be able to nudge any asteroids with its gravity.

A similar result, albeit for different reasons, arises when considering the impact rate of short period comets on Earth. Currently, Jupiter's gravity is capable of throwing comets close to the Earth, as we saw with Lexell's Comet, but it is also equally adept at cleaning up its mess and removing dangerous comets from the solar system.

Were Jupiter only to have one-fifth of its real mass, the balance between hurling comets towards us and then removing them would be lost; Jupiter would still be able to destabilize comets and send them our way, but it would lose the ability to remove many of them.

"If you have a low mass Jupiter, it is capable of placing things on Earth-crossing orbits but because it doesn't have a big gravitational reach, once it has put a comet on an Earth-crossing orbit the comet can remain in that orbit for a very long time before it encounters Jupiter again," says Horner.

Better The Devil You Know?

Jupiter's role seems confused. It definitely sends asteroids and comets our way and, in any given year, more than 90 percent of all objects crossing Earth's orbit are asteroids, so the protection Jupiter provides us from long period comets, or by eventually removing short period comets, is of lesser importance. Hence Jupiter is not the friend that it has been perceived to be.

However, things could be far worse: were Jupiter to have a mere 20 percent of its mass, the impact rate would skyrocket. Obviously for any denizens on a planet in the target zone this is bad news, but in the grand scheme of things are impacts a positive or negative factor on the overall evolution of life on a planet across billions of years? When searching for potentially habitable exoplanets, should we seek to avoid systems that contain a 0.2 Jupiter-mass gas giant at a similar distance to Jupiter from the sun?

Whether impacts have been a good thing or a bad thing for the evolution of life on Earth depends on who you talk to, says Dave Waltham, Head of the Earth Sciences Department at Royal Holloway, University of London. "What you can definitely say is that they cause some mass extinctions. Lots of people argue, however, that impacts can be good because they stir thing up and stop the biosphere from becoming stuck in a rut. Certainly for human beings, we wouldn't be here if the dinosaurs hadn't been wiped out."

The Star of Bethlehem: Was it Jupiter?

Impacts may only be healthy in the long run if they are not so frequent as to not give the biosphere chance to recover. Evidence in Earth's geological record suggests that it takes around ten million years following a big impact for the planet to heal, so an impact rate of one large collision every hundred million years or so, as Earth experiences, allows plenty of time between crashes for life to flourish. On the other hand if that impact rate was every few million years, the bombardment would pulverize our planet into a lifeless husk with little opportunity to develop a new biosphere.

Horner and Jones' simulations are now beginning to feed into discussions regarding habitability on planets around other stars. "In Peter Ward and Donald Brownlee's book Rare Earth, they set Jupiter up as a shield, but they didn't really demonstrate it," says Waltham, a self-confessed 'Rare Earther'. "Jonti (Jonathan Horner) and Barrie went out and tested that idea and in doing so removed one of the barriers to habitability."

Too Much Water?

Impacts have an additional benefit: they bring water to otherwise dry worlds. Our current understanding of how planets form is that Earth was born dry -- temperatures were so hot that its surface was molten and any resident water was driven off. So why do we now live on a world that is replete in watery oceans?

The idea is that the water was brought here by objects that crashed into Earth, which were either asteroids or comets (the current consensus is leaning towards asteroids, based upon the discovery that the isotopes of hydrogen in Earth's water do not match the isotopes of hydrogen seen in comets). One can imagine that in an environment with too few impacts Earth would have remained as dry as the moon, and so a perturbing body like Jupiter might therefore be needed to ensure there is water present for life. On the flip-side, too many impacts could easily bring too much water.

"Earth's water is ample and there is a lot more than we would expect given where Earth formed, but you could imagine a scenario where you have a hundred or a thousand times more water and there is no solid land," says Horner.

The prospects for habitability on water worlds may be surprisingly dire, adds Waltham. "Having too much water could be a problem because Earth's climate system is, to a considerable extent, controlled by the fact that we have a mix of land and sea," he says, referring to the carbon-silicate cycle, the process by which carbon and hence global warming and atmospheric temperatures are regulated. Volcanoes spew carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which helps warm the planet, and when the climate grows too warm rain levels increase and the carbon dioxide is washed out in a slightly acidic precipitation that weathers rocks on the surface, creating calcium carbonate, bicarbonate and silica that runs-off into the oceans. Here it becomes incorporated into sea-dwelling micro-organisms that die and carry the carbon down to the sea floor, where it enters subduction zones and is eventually recycled and spewed out once more from volcanoes. Without land, the silicate weathering cannot take place, causing a fatal break in the chain.

Whereas Waltham believes Earth-like planets are rare, Horner is more the optimist and recognizes that his work with Barrie Jones has removed one of the obstacles to long-term habitability and may help act as a pointer in where to search for life in the Universe. "We'll soon go from the stage of knowing no other planets like Earth to knowing hundreds of them, and people want to look for life," he says.

"The problem is it is very difficult and time-consuming to search, so you'll only be able to look at one or two and you need to have some way of saying which are the best and worst prospects. I don't think it will be a clear cut 'this will be habitable, this won't be habitable', I think it will be 'this is a bit more habitable, this is a bit less habitable' and impacts are certainly one of the important factors."

From alien life to human life, impacts have a large influence. In the knowledge that Jupiter is far from being our savior and that the asteroid that finished off the dinosaurs may not merely have been one that slipped through the net, programs such as NASA's Spaceguard survey that seek out potentially hazardous objects are all the more vital. We must thank impacts for bringing water to Earth and paving the way for humans to evolve, but we must also never, ever stop watching the skies.

THE GIST

    * Using its gravitational dominance to 'vacuum' errant space rocks, Jupiter is often hailed as Earth's protector.
    * However, it is known that comets' orbits have been modified by Jupiter's gravity, sending them our way.

Whilst most famous for his catalog of 110 galaxies, nebulae, clusters and double stars, Charles Messier was a comet-hunter at heart. His catalog was simply a list of nuisances, faint fuzzies that looked like comets but were not.

The Frenchman found 13 comets in all between 1760 and 1785, but perhaps the most important of them was the streaking comet that he spotted in June 1770. Fast moving on the sky, it was bright enough at magnitude +2 that it could be clearly seen from well-lit towns and cities. A brief spectacle of wonder for eighteenth century astronomers to enjoy, its ramifications could have been much greater.

The comet has since become known as Lexell's Comet, after the Russian (yet Swedish born) astronomer Anders Johan Lexell who first calculated its orbit. He showed that the comet had made a close approach of just 2.2 million kilometers (0.015 AU), which is about six times the distance to the moon. It was the closest a comet has ever been witnessed to approach the Earth and, in astronomical terms, a very near (and fortunate) miss.

ANALYSIS: Nuking Asteroids: It's a Megaton Of Fun!
Lexell found that the comet swooped around the sun with an orbital period of just under six years, but its next return in 1776 would see it on the far side of the sun, out of harm's way. Sure enough, no astronomers found it again that year. In 1782 however, when again it was predicted to be visible, the comet was nowhere in sight.

The French mathematician Pierre Simon-Laplace calculated that the comet had experienced a set of encounters with the giant planet Jupiter. The first saw Jupiter's gravity modify the comet's orbit to fling it almost onto a direct collision course with Earth. The second encounter modified the comet's orbit, ejecting it from the solar system altogether and removing it as a potential hazard.

Lexell is now a lost comet and Jupiter is the reason why nobody had ever seen it before 1770, and why no one ever saw it afterwards. In doing so, Jupiter played the role of both Earth's friend and Earth's foe.

The story of Lexell's Comet was pretty much forgotten in the decades and centuries that followed. By the 1960s astronomers looked upon long period comets -- comets that hail from the Oort Cloud at the very edge of our solar system and which take many millennia to orbit the sun -- as the major impact hazard to Earth.

A general idea developed, bolstered by computer simulations performed in 1994 by the late George Wetherill of the Carnegie Institution, that dictated how Jupiter acted as Earth's protector, sweeping up or ejecting many of the long period comets from the solar system and removing them from the population of potential impactors (Wetherill's simulations coincided with comet ShoemakerLevy 9 colliding with Jupiter). This idea has taken hold in established theory yet few have ever really questioned it until now.

SLIDE SHOW: Top 10 Ways to Stop an Asteroid

Realizing that today we know of many more short period comets and near-Earth asteroids that cross our planet's orbit than long period comets, Jonathan Horner of the University of New South Wales, Sydney and Barrie Jones of the UK's Open University have run new simulations that reveal a very different picture, one that has important consequences for the habitability of Earth and planets in general.

"When George Wetherill did his work back in 1994, the computers available to him were much more limited than what we have today," says Horner, who originally comes from the U.K. "The lack of computing power meant that he had to make some fairly big approximations and simplifications. His was a ground-breaking study but at the same time it was one that was limited by what he had available."

Horner and Jones decided to run the experiment again but this time with twenty-first century computing power, hooking up tens of computers in parallel at the Open University. Their simulations agreed that Jupiter is a factor in protecting Earth from long period comets, but how would it fare with the new populations of short period comets and near Earth asteroids? Described in a series of papers published in the International Journal of Astrobiology, the duo found their answer to be at odds with conventional theory.

Gravitational Resonances

Movies such as Armageddon and Deep Impact, combined with the common consensus that an asteroid strike 65 million years ago finished off the reign of the dinosaurs, has meant that the notion of asteroids hitting Earth is now part of our pop culture. These objects hail from the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter.

While most asteroids move on stable orbits around the sun, neighboring Jupiter's influence looms large and gravitational resonances between the planet and regions of the Asteroid Belt are adept at clearing out any rogue asteroids in these regions and sending them hurtling in-system. Often these rogues can originate from collisions between asteroids that send a shower of rocky chunks spinning off into these resonant zones.

"The main thing that is driving material from the Asteroid Belt into the inner solar system is the influence of something called a secular resonance," says Horner. "As things stand now in our solar system, this particular secular resonance is right at the inner edge of the asteroid belt."

In their simulations Horner and Jones played about with the mass of Jupiter, finding that the lower the planet's mass, the broader the secular resonance becomes and the more it moves into the main body of the Asteroid Belt, closer to Jupiter, leading to more asteroids being perturbed.

ANALYSIS: Violent History Preserved in Hayabusa's Asteroid Grains

The simulations showed that the number of asteroid impacts on Earth peaks when there is a planet in Jupiter's orbit that has a mass one-fifth that of Jupiter's mass, whereas just over half the peak rate of impacts occur when there is a planet with a mass equal to Jupiter. The impact rate falls off again at the lower extreme, when Jupiter's mass becomes too low to be able to nudge any asteroids with its gravity.

A similar result, albeit for different reasons, arises when considering the impact rate of short period comets on Earth. Currently, Jupiter's gravity is capable of throwing comets close to the Earth, as we saw with Lexell's Comet, but it is also equally adept at cleaning up its mess and removing dangerous comets from the solar system.

Were Jupiter only to have one-fifth of its real mass, the balance between hurling comets towards us and then removing them would be lost; Jupiter would still be able to destabilize comets and send them our way, but it would lose the ability to remove many of them.

"If you have a low mass Jupiter, it is capable of placing things on Earth-crossing orbits but because it doesn't have a big gravitational reach, once it has put a comet on an Earth-crossing orbit the comet can remain in that orbit for a very long time before it encounters Jupiter again," says Horner.

Better The Devil You Know?

Jupiter's role seems confused. It definitely sends asteroids and comets our way and, in any given year, more than 90 percent of all objects crossing Earth's orbit are asteroids, so the protection Jupiter provides us from long period comets, or by eventually removing short period comets, is of lesser importance. Hence Jupiter is not the friend that it has been perceived to be.

However, things could be far worse: were Jupiter to have a mere 20 percent of its mass, the impact rate would skyrocket. Obviously for any denizens on a planet in the target zone this is bad news, but in the grand scheme of things are impacts a positive or negative factor on the overall evolution of life on a planet across billions of years? When searching for potentially habitable exoplanets, should we seek to avoid systems that contain a 0.2 Jupiter-mass gas giant at a similar distance to Jupiter from the sun?

Whether impacts have been a good thing or a bad thing for the evolution of life on Earth depends on who you talk to, says Dave Waltham, Head of the Earth Sciences Department at Royal Holloway, University of London. "What you can definitely say is that they cause some mass extinctions. Lots of people argue, however, that impacts can be good because they stir thing up and stop the biosphere from becoming stuck in a rut. Certainly for human beings, we wouldn't be here if the dinosaurs hadn't been wiped out."

The Star of Bethlehem: Was it Jupiter?

Impacts may only be healthy in the long run if they are not so frequent as to not give the biosphere chance to recover. Evidence in Earth's geological record suggests that it takes around ten million years following a big impact for the planet to heal, so an impact rate of one large collision every hundred million years or so, as Earth experiences, allows plenty of time between crashes for life to flourish. On the other hand if that impact rate was every few million years, the bombardment would pulverize our planet into a lifeless husk with little opportunity to develop a new biosphere.

Horner and Jones' simulations are now beginning to feed into discussions regarding habitability on planets around other stars. "In Peter Ward and Donald Brownlee's book Rare Earth, they set Jupiter up as a shield, but they didn't really demonstrate it," says Waltham, a self-confessed 'Rare Earther'. "Jonti (Jonathan Horner) and Barrie went out and tested that idea and in doing so removed one of the barriers to habitability."

Too Much Water?

Impacts have an additional benefit: they bring water to otherwise dry worlds. Our current understanding of how planets form is that Earth was born dry -- temperatures were so hot that its surface was molten and any resident water was driven off. So why do we now live on a world that is replete in watery oceans?

The idea is that the water was brought here by objects that crashed into Earth, which were either asteroids or comets (the current consensus is leaning towards asteroids, based upon the discovery that the isotopes of hydrogen in Earth's water do not match the isotopes of hydrogen seen in comets). One can imagine that in an environment with too few impacts Earth would have remained as dry as the moon, and so a perturbing body like Jupiter might therefore be needed to ensure there is water present for life. On the flip-side, too many impacts could easily bring too much water.

"Earth's water is ample and there is a lot more than we would expect given where Earth formed, but you could imagine a scenario where you have a hundred or a thousand times more water and there is no solid land," says Horner.

The prospects for habitability on water worlds may be surprisingly dire, adds Waltham. "Having too much water could be a problem because Earth's climate system is, to a considerable extent, controlled by the fact that we have a mix of land and sea," he says, referring to the carbon-silicate cycle, the process by which carbon and hence global warming and atmospheric temperatures are regulated. Volcanoes spew carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which helps warm the planet, and when the climate grows too warm rain levels increase and the carbon dioxide is washed out in a slightly acidic precipitation that weathers rocks on the surface, creating calcium carbonate, bicarbonate and silica that runs-off into the oceans. Here it becomes incorporated into sea-dwelling micro-organisms that die and carry the carbon down to the sea floor, where it enters subduction zones and is eventually recycled and spewed out once more from volcanoes. Without land, the silicate weathering cannot take place, causing a fatal break in the chain.

Whereas Waltham believes Earth-like planets are rare, Horner is more the optimist and recognizes that his work with Barrie Jones has removed one of the obstacles to long-term habitability and may help act as a pointer in where to search for life in the Universe. "We'll soon go from the stage of knowing no other planets like Earth to knowing hundreds of them, and people want to look for life," he says.

"The problem is it is very difficult and time-consuming to search, so you'll only be able to look at one or two and you need to have some way of saying which are the best and worst prospects. I don't think it will be a clear cut 'this will be habitable, this won't be habitable', I think it will be 'this is a bit more habitable, this is a bit less habitable' and impacts are certainly one of the important factors."

From alien life to human life, impacts have a large influence. In the knowledge that Jupiter is far from being our savior and that the asteroid that finished off the dinosaurs may not merely have been one that slipped through the net, programs such as NASA's Spaceguard survey that seek out potentially hazardous objects are all the more vital. We must thank impacts for bringing water to Earth and paving the way for humans to evolve, but we must also never, ever stop watching the skies.

"Having too much water could be a problem because Earth's climate system is, to a considerable extent, controlled by the fact that we have a mix of land and sea," he says, referring to the carbon-silicate cycle, the process by which carbon and hence global warming and atmospheric temperatures are regulated. Volcanoes spew carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which helps warm the planet, and when the climate grows too warm rain levels increase and the carbon dioxide is washed out in a slightly acidic precipitation that weathers rocks on the surface, creating calcium carbonate, bicarbonate and silica that runs-off into the oceans. Here it becomes incorporated into sea-dwelling micro-organisms that die and carry the carbon down to the sea floor, where it enters subduction zones and is eventually recycled and spewed out once more from volcanoes. Without land, the silicate weathering cannot take place, causing a fatal break in the chain.

Whereas Waltham believes Earth-like planets are rare, Horner is more the optimist and recognizes that his work with Barrie Jones has removed one of the obstacles to long-term habitability and may help act as a pointer in where to search for life in the Universe. "We'll soon go from the stage of knowing no other planets like Earth to knowing hundreds of them, and people want to look for life," he says.

"The problem is it is very difficult and time-consuming to search, so you'll only be able to look at one or two and you need to have some way of saying which are the best and worst prospects. I don't think it will be a clear cut 'this will be habitable, this won't be habitable', I think it will be 'this is a bit more habitable, this is a bit less habitable' and impacts are certainly one of the important factors."

From alien life to human life, impacts have a large influence. In the knowledge that Jupiter is far from being our savior and that the asteroid that finished off the dinosaurs may not merely have been one that slipped through the net, programs such as NASA's Spaceguard survey that seek out potentially hazardous objects are all the more vital. We must thank impacts for bringing water to Earth and paving the way for humans to evolve, but we must also never, ever stop watching the skies.

THE GIST

    * Using its gravitational dominance to 'vacuum' errant space rocks, Jupiter is often hailed as Earth's protector.
    * However, it is known that comets' orbits have been modified by Jupiter's gravity, sending them our way.

Whilst most famous for his catalog of 110 galaxies, nebulae, clusters and double stars, Charles Messier was a comet-hunter at heart. His catalog was simply a list of nuisances, faint fuzzies that looked like comets but were not.

The Frenchman found 13 comets in all between 1760 and 1785, but perhaps the most important of them was the streaking comet that he spotted in June 1770. Fast moving on the sky, it was bright enough at magnitude +2 that it could be clearly seen from well-lit towns and cities. A brief spectacle of wonder for eighteenth century astronomers to enjoy, its ramifications could have been much greater.

The comet has since become known as Lexell's Comet, after the Russian (yet Swedish born) astronomer Anders Johan Lexell who first calculated its orbit. He showed that the comet had made a close approach of just 2.2 million kilometers (0.015 AU), which is about six times the distance to the moon. It was the closest a comet has ever been witnessed to approach the Earth and, in astronomical terms, a very near (and fortunate) miss.

ANALYSIS: Nuking Asteroids: It's a Megaton Of Fun!
Lexell found that the comet swooped around the sun with an orbital period of just under six years, but its next return in 1776 would see it on the far side of the sun, out of harm's way. Sure enough, no astronomers found it again that year. In 1782 however, when again it was predicted to be visible, the comet was nowhere in sight.

The French mathematician Pierre Simon-Laplace calculated that the comet had experienced a set of encounters with the giant planet Jupiter. The first saw Jupiter's gravity modify the comet's orbit to fling it almost onto a direct collision course with Earth. The second encounter modified the comet's orbit, ejecting it from the solar system altogether and removing it as a potential hazard.

Lexell is now a lost comet and Jupiter is the reason why nobody had ever seen it before 1770, and why no one ever saw it afterwards. In doing so, Jupiter played the role of both Earth's friend and Earth's foe.

The story of Lexell's Comet was pretty much forgotten in the decades and centuries that followed. By the 1960s astronomers looked upon long period comets -- comets that hail from the Oort Cloud at the very edge of our solar system and which take many millennia to orbit the sun -- as the major impact hazard to Earth.

A general idea developed, bolstered by computer simulations performed in 1994 by the late George Wetherill of the Carnegie Institution, that dictated how Jupiter acted as Earth's protector, sweeping up or ejecting many of the long period comets from the solar system and removing them from the population of potential impactors (Wetherill's simulations coincided with comet ShoemakerLevy 9 colliding with Jupiter). This idea has taken hold in established theory yet few have ever really questioned it until now.

SLIDE SHOW: Top 10 Ways to Stop an Asteroid

Realizing that today we know of many more short period comets and near-Earth asteroids that cross our planet's orbit than long period comets, Jonathan Horner of the University of New South Wales, Sydney and Barrie Jones of the UK's Open University have run new simulations that reveal a very different picture, one that has important consequences for the habitability of Earth and planets in general.

"When George Wetherill did his work back in 1994, the computers available to him were much more limited than what we have today," says Horner, who originally comes from the U.K. "The lack of computing power meant that he had to make some fairly big approximations and simplifications. His was a ground-breaking study but at the same time it was one that was limited by what he had available."

Horner and Jones decided to run the experiment again but this time with twenty-first century computing power, hooking up tens of computers in parallel at the Open University. Their simulations agreed that Jupiter is a factor in protecting Earth from long period comets, but how would it fare with the new populations of short period comets and near Earth asteroids? Described in a series of papers published in the International Journal of Astrobiology, the duo found their answer to be at odds with conventional theory.

WATCH VIDEO: DOOMSDAY ASTEROIDS

Gravitational Resonances

Movies such as Armageddon and Deep Impact, combined with the common consensus that an asteroid strike 65 million years ago finished off the reign of the dinosaurs, has meant that the notion of asteroids hitting Earth is now part of our pop culture. These objects hail from the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter.

While most asteroids move on stable orbits around the sun, neighboring Jupiter's influence looms large and gravitational resonances between the planet and regions of the Asteroid Belt are adept at clearing out any rogue asteroids in these regions and sending them hurtling in-system. Often these rogues can originate from collisions between asteroids that send a shower of rocky chunks spinning off into these resonant zones.

"The main thing that is driving material from the Asteroid Belt into the inner solar system is the influence of something called a secular resonance," says Horner. "As things stand now in our solar system, this particular secular resonance is right at the inner edge of the asteroid belt."

In their simulations Horner and Jones played about with the mass of Jupiter, finding that the lower the planet's mass, the broader the secular resonance becomes and the more it moves into the main body of the Asteroid Belt, closer to Jupiter, leading to more asteroids being perturbed.

ANALYSIS: Violent History Preserved in Hayabusa's Asteroid Grains

The simulations showed that the number of asteroid impacts on Earth peaks when there is a planet in Jupiter's orbit that has a mass one-fifth that of Jupiter's mass, whereas just over half the peak rate of impacts occur when there is a planet with a mass equal to Jupiter. The impact rate falls off again at the lower extreme, when Jupiter's mass becomes too low to be able to nudge any asteroids with its gravity.

A similar result, albeit for different reasons, arises when considering the impact rate of short period comets on Earth. Currently, Jupiter's gravity is capable of throwing comets close to the Earth, as we saw with Lexell's Comet, but it is also equally adept at cleaning up its mess and removing dangerous comets from the solar system.

Were Jupiter only to have one-fifth of its real mass, the balance between hurling comets towards us and then removing them would be lost; Jupiter would still be able to destabilize comets and send them our way, but it would lose the ability to remove many of them.

"If you have a low mass Jupiter, it is capable of placing things on Earth-crossing orbits but because it doesn't have a big gravitational reach, once it has put a comet on an Earth-crossing orbit the comet can remain in that orbit for a very long time before it encounters Jupiter again," says Horner.

Better The Devil You Know?

Jupiter's role seems confused. It definitely sends asteroids and comets our way and, in any given year, more than 90 percent of all objects crossing Earth's orbit are asteroids, so the protection Jupiter provides us from long period comets, or by eventually removing short period comets, is of lesser importance. Hence Jupiter is not the friend that it has been perceived to be.

However, things could be far worse: were Jupiter to have a mere 20 percent of its mass, the impact rate would skyrocket. Obviously for any denizens on a planet in the target zone this is bad news, but in the grand scheme of things are impacts a positive or negative factor on the overall evolution of life on a planet across billions of years? When searching for potentially habitable exoplanets, should we seek to avoid systems that contain a 0.2 Jupiter-mass gas giant at a similar distance to Jupiter from the sun?

Whether impacts have been a good thing or a bad thing for the evolution of life on Earth depends on who you talk to, says Dave Waltham, Head of the Earth Sciences Department at Royal Holloway, University of London. "What you can definitely say is that they cause some mass extinctions. Lots of people argue, however, that impacts can be good because they stir thing up and stop the biosphere from becoming stuck in a rut. Certainly for human beings, we wouldn't be here if the dinosaurs hadn't been wiped out."

The Star of Bethlehem: Was it Jupiter?

Impacts may only be healthy in the long run if they are not so frequent as to not give the biosphere chance to recover. Evidence in Earth's geological record suggests that it takes around ten million years following a big impact for the planet to heal, so an impact rate of one large collision every hundred million years or so, as Earth experiences, allows plenty of time between crashes for life to flourish. On the other hand if that impact rate was every few million years, the bombardment would pulverize our planet into a lifeless husk with little opportunity to develop a new biosphere.

Horner and Jones' simulations are now beginning to feed into discussions regarding habitability on planets around other stars. "In Peter Ward and Donald Brownlee's book Rare Earth, they set Jupiter up as a shield, but they didn't really demonstrate it," says Waltham, a self-confessed 'Rare Earther'. "Jonti (Jonathan Horner) and Barrie went out and tested that idea and in doing so removed one of the barriers to habitability."

Too Much Water?

Impacts have an additional benefit: they bring water to otherwise dry worlds. Our current understanding of how planets form is that Earth was born dry -- temperatures were so hot that its surface was molten and any resident water was driven off. So why do we now live on a world that is replete in watery oceans?

The idea is that the water was brought here by objects that crashed into Earth, which were either asteroids or comets (the current consensus is leaning towards asteroids, based upon the discovery that the isotopes of hydrogen in Earth's water do not match the isotopes of hydrogen seen in comets). One can imagine that in an environment with too few impacts Earth would have remained as dry as the moon, and so a perturbing body like Jupiter might therefore be needed to ensure there is water present for life. On the flip-side, too many impacts could easily bring too much water.

"Earth's water is ample and there is a lot more than we would expect given where Earth formed, but you could imagine a scenario where you have a hundred or a thousand times more water and there is no solid land," says Horner.

The prospects for habitability on water worlds may be surprisingly dire, adds Waltham. "Having too much water could be a problem because Earth's climate system is, to a considerable extent, controlled by the fact that we have a mix of land and sea," he says, referring to the carbon-silicate cycle, the process by which carbon and hence global warming and atmospheric temperatures are regulated. Volcanoes spew carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which helps warm the planet, and when the climate grows too warm rain levels increase and the carbon dioxide is washed out in a slightly acidic precipitation that weathers rocks on the surface, creating calcium carbonate, bicarbonate and silica that runs-off into the oceans. Here it becomes incorporated into sea-dwelling micro-organisms that die and carry the carbon down to the sea floor, where it enters subduction zones and is eventually recycled and spewed out once more from volcanoes. Without land, the silicate weathering cannot take place, causing a fatal break in the chain.

Whereas Waltham believes Earth-like planets are rare, Horner is more the optimist and recognizes that his work with Barrie Jones has removed one of the obstacles to long-term habitability and may help act as a pointer in where to search for life in the Universe. "We'll soon go from the stage of knowing no other planets like Earth to knowing hundreds of them, and people want to look for life," he says.

"The problem is it is very difficult and time-consuming to search, so you'll only be able to look at one or two and you need to have some way of saying which are the best and worst prospects. I don't think it will be a clear cut 'this will be habitable, this won't be habitable', I think it will be 'this is a bit more habitable, this is a bit less habitable' and impacts are certainly one of the important factors."

From alien life to human life, impacts have a large influence. In the knowledge that Jupiter is far from being our savior and that the asteroid that finished off the dinosaurs may not merely have been one that slipped through the net, programs such as NASA's Spaceguard survey that seek out potentially hazardous objects are all the more vital. We must thank impacts for bringing water to Earth and paving the way for humans to evolve, but we must also never, ever stop watching the skies.

By Martial Trezzini, AP

Kofi Annan gives a statement after his address to the Security Council in New York at the United Nations headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.

UNITED NATIONS (AP)  France circulated a proposed statement to the U.N.Security Council on Monday that urges the Syrian government to immediately implement proposals by international envoy Kofi Annan to end the yearlong bloodshed.

The statement would pledge to consider "further measures"  which could include sanctions or military action  if it doesn't.

Annan, a former U.N. secretary-general, asked the council Friday to unite behind his effort to end the yearlong bloodshed that the United Nations says has killed more than 8,000 people. According to U.N. diplomats, he said the stronger and more unified the message from the Security Council, the better the chances of shifting the dynamics of the conflict.

The draft presidential statement, obtained by the Associated Press, expresses "full support" for Annan and the six-point plan he presented to Syrian President Bashar Assad during two meetings in Damascus on March 10-11 as the joint envoy for the U.N. and Arab League.

It would express the council's "gravest concern at the deteriorating situation in Syria which has resulted in a serious human rights crisis and a deplorable humanitarian situation." It would also express "profound regret" at the thousands of deaths.

Russia and China have vetoed two U.S. and European-backed resolutions that would have condemned President Bashar Assad's bloody crackdown on civilians, saying they were unbalanced and demanded an end to government attacks only, not the opposition.

The proposed statement does not address the issue of responsibility. But Russia and China are likely to oppose raising the possibility that the council would consider "further measures" if Syrian doesn't immediately implement Annan's proposals. Both countries have adamantly rejected any mention of such measures because they believe the NATO bombing campaign in Libya overstepped the council's mandate to protect civilians.

The draft calls on the Syrian government and opposition to work with Annan and "to implement fully and immediately his initial six-point plan." If adopted, the council would review implementation of Annan's plan and consider "further measures" in seven days, a time frame that is also likely to be opposed by some council members as being too short.

Britain's U.N. Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant, the current council president, told reporters the council will discuss the draft presidential statement backing Annan on Tuesday as well as a press statement proposed by Russia, Syria's closest ally, on the recent attacks in Damascus and Aleppo.

France's U.N. Ambassador Gerard Araud said he introduced a presidential statement to give quick backing to Annan because a resolution would take a week or two.

Presidential statements become part of the Security Council's permanent record and are stronger than press statements which do not. But unlike resolutions, neither statement is legally binding.

A key point in Annan's plan as spelled out in the draft calls for Syria to "commit to stop the fighting and achieve urgently an effective United Nations supervised cessation of armed violence by all parties" As these actions are being taken, Annan "shall seek similar commitments from all other armed groups to cease violence, under an effective United Nations supervision mechanism," it said.

Syria told Annan in a letter obtained Saturday by The Associated Press that it is "keen to end violence" but insisted that armed opposition groups give up their weapons first. It also demanded that Annan halt the supply and financing of weapons to the opposition.

The Syrian response fell far short of U.S. and European demands that Syrian forces stop fighting first  and even Russia's insistence that both sides lay down their arms simultaneously. But it did leave the door open for talks.

Annan has sent a five-member team to Syria to discuss practical steps to implement his proposal.

U.N. deputy spokesman Eduardo del Buey quoted Annan's spokesman, Ahmad Fawzi, as saying Monday that the team, with expertise on political, peacekeeping and mediation issues, will stay as long as it is making progress in reaching agreement on practical steps to implement Annan's proposals.

The other points in Annan's proposal, spelled out in the draft, call for Syria:

 to work with Annan in establishing "an inclusive Syrian-led political dialogue to address the legitimate aspirations and concerns of the Syrian people"

to ensure the timely delivery of humanitarian aid to all areas affected by the fighting

to intensify "the pace and scale of release of arbitrarily detained persons."

to ensure freedom of movement throughout the country for journalists

to ensure freedom of association and the right to demonstrate peacefully "as legally guaranteed."

In its response reported Saturday, Syria insisted that there have been no "random arrests" during the uprising and said humanitarian access would depend on its assessment of the local situation, in consultation with the Red Cross. It also said Syria allows "the entry for the media with freedom of movement according to the Syrian laws and regulations."

Kofi Annan gives a statement after his address to the Security Council in New York at the United Nations headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.

UNITED NATIONS (AP)  France circulated a proposed statement to the U.N.Security Council on Monday that urges the Syrian government to immediately implement proposals by international envoy Kofi Annan to end the yearlong bloodshed.

The statement would pledge to consider "further measures"  which could include sanctions or military action  if it doesn't.

Annan, a former U.N. secretary-general, asked the council Friday to unite behind his effort to end the yearlong bloodshed that the United Nations says has killed more than 8,000 people. According to U.N. diplomats, he said the stronger and more unified the message from the Security Council, the better the chances of shifting the dynamics of the conflict.

The draft presidential statement, obtained by the Associated Press, expresses "full support" for Annan and the six-point plan he presented to Syrian President Bashar Assad during two meetings in Damascus on March 10-11 as the joint envoy for the U.N. and Arab League.

It would express the council's "gravest concern at the deteriorating situation in Syria which has resulted in a serious human rights crisis and a deplorable humanitarian situation." It would also express "profound regret" at the thousands of deaths.

Russia and China have vetoed two U.S. and European-backed resolutions that would have condemned President Bashar Assad's bloody crackdown on civilians, saying they were unbalanced and demanded an end to government attacks only, not the opposition.

The proposed statement does not address the issue of responsibility. But Russia and China are likely to oppose raising the possibility that the council would consider "further measures" if Syrian doesn't immediately implement Annan's proposals. Both countries have adamantly rejected any mention of such measures because they believe the NATO bombing campaign in Libya overstepped the council's mandate to protect civilians.

The draft calls on the Syrian government and opposition to work with Annan and "to implement fully and immediately his initial six-point plan." If adopted, the council would review implementation of Annan's plan and consider "further measures" in seven days, a time frame that is also likely to be opposed by some council members as being too short.

Britain's U.N. Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant, the current council president, told reporters the council will discuss the draft presidential statement backing Annan on Tuesday as well as a press statement proposed by Russia, Syria's closest ally, on the recent attacks in Damascus and Aleppo.

France's U.N. Ambassador Gerard Araud said he introduced a presidential statement to give quick backing to Annan because a resolution would take a week or two.

Presidential statements become part of the Security Council's permanent record and are stronger than press statements which do not. But unlike resolutions, neither statement is legally binding.

A key point in Annan's plan as spelled out in the draft calls for Syria to "commit to stop the fighting and achieve urgently an effective United Nations supervised cessation of armed violence by all parties" As these actions are being taken, Annan "shall seek similar commitments from all other armed groups to cease violence, under an effective United Nations supervision mechanism," it said.

Syria told Annan in a letter obtained Saturday by The Associated Press that it is "keen to end violence" but insisted that armed opposition groups give up their weapons first. It also demanded that Annan halt the supply and financing of weapons to the opposition.

The Syrian response fell far short of U.S. and European demands that Syrian forces stop fighting first  and even Russia's insistence that both sides lay down their arms simultaneously. But it did leave the door open for talks.

Annan has sent a five-member team to Syria to discuss practical steps to implement his proposal.

U.N. deputy spokesman Eduardo del Buey quoted Annan's spokesman, Ahmad Fawzi, as saying Monday that the team, with expertise on political, peacekeeping and mediation issues, will stay as long as it is making progress in reaching agreement on practical steps to implement Annan's proposals.

The other points in Annan's proposal, spelled out in the draft, call for Syria:

 to work with Annan in establishing "an inclusive Syrian-led political dialogue to address the legitimate aspirations and concerns of the Syrian people"

to ensure the timely delivery of humanitarian aid to all areas affected by the fighting

to intensify "the pace and scale of release of arbitrarily detained persons."

to ensure freedom of movement throughout the country for journalists

to ensure freedom of association and the right to demonstrate peacefully "as legally guaranteed."

In its response reported Saturday, Syria insisted that there have been no "random arrests" during the uprising and said humanitarian access would depend on its assessment of the local situation, in consultation with the Red Cross. It also said Syria allows "the entry for the media with freedom of movement according to the Syrian laws and regulations."

Kofi Annan gives a statement after his address to the Security Council in New York at the United Nations headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.

UNITED NATIONS (AP)  France circulated a proposed statement to the U.N.Security Council on Monday that urges the Syrian government to immediately implement proposals by international envoy Kofi Annan to end the yearlong bloodshed.

The statement would pledge to consider "further measures"  which could include sanctions or military action  if it doesn't.

Annan, a former U.N. secretary-general, asked the council Friday to unite behind his effort to end the yearlong bloodshed that the United Nations says has killed more than 8,000 people. According to U.N. diplomats, he said the stronger and more unified the message from the Security Council, the better the chances of shifting the dynamics of the conflict.

The draft presidential statement, obtained by the Associated Press, expresses "full support" for Annan and the six-point plan he presented to Syrian President Bashar Assad during two meetings in Damascus on March 10-11 as the joint envoy for the U.N. and Arab League.

It would express the council's "gravest concern at the deteriorating situation in Syria which has resulted in a serious human rights crisis and a deplorable humanitarian situation." It would also express "profound regret" at the thousands of deaths.

Russia and China have vetoed two U.S. and European-backed resolutions that would have condemned President Bashar Assad's bloody crackdown on civilians, saying they were unbalanced and demanded an end to government attacks only, not the opposition.

The proposed statement does not address the issue of responsibility. But Russia and China are likely to oppose raising the possibility that the council would consider "further measures" if Syrian doesn't immediately implement Annan's proposals. Both countries have adamantly rejected any mention of such measures because they believe the NATO bombing campaign in Libya overstepped the council's mandate to protect civilians.

The draft calls on the Syrian government and opposition to work with Annan and "to implement fully and immediately his initial six-point plan." If adopted, the council would review implementation of Annan's plan and consider "further measures" in seven days, a time frame that is also likely to be opposed by some council members as being too short.

Britain's U.N. Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant, the current council president, told reporters the council will discuss the draft presidential statement backing Annan on Tuesday as well as a press statement proposed by Russia, Syria's closest ally, on the recent attacks in Damascus and Aleppo.

France's U.N. Ambassador Gerard Araud said he introduced a presidential statement to give quick backing to Annan because a resolution would take a week or two.

Presidential statements become part of the Security Council's permanent record and are stronger than press statements which do not. But unlike resolutions, neither statement is legally binding.

A key point in Annan's plan as spelled out in the draft calls for Syria to "commit to stop the fighting and achieve urgently an effective United Nations supervised cessation of armed violence by all parties" As these actions are being taken, Annan "shall seek similar commitments from all other armed groups to cease violence, under an effective United Nations supervision mechanism," it said.

Syria told Annan in a letter obtained Saturday by The Associated Press that it is "keen to end violence" but insisted that armed opposition groups give up their weapons first. It also demanded that Annan halt the supply and financing of weapons to the opposition.

The Syrian response fell far short of U.S. and European demands that Syrian forces stop fighting first  and even Russia's insistence that both sides lay down their arms simultaneously. But it did leave the door open for talks.

Annan has sent a five-member team to Syria to discuss practical steps to implement his proposal.

U.N. deputy spokesman Eduardo del Buey quoted Annan's spokesman, Ahmad Fawzi, as saying Monday that the team, with expertise on political, peacekeeping and mediation issues, will stay as long as it is making progress in reaching agreement on practical steps to implement Annan's proposals.

The other points in Annan's proposal, spelled out in the draft, call for Syria:

 to work with Annan in establishing "an inclusive Syrian-led political dialogue to address the legitimate aspirations and concerns of the Syrian people"

to ensure the timely delivery of humanitarian aid to all areas affected by the fighting

to intensify "the pace and scale of release of arbitrarily detained persons."

to ensure freedom of movement throughout the country for journalists

to ensure freedom of association and the right to demonstrate peacefully "as legally guaranteed."

In its response reported Saturday, Syria insisted that there have been no "random arrests" during the uprising and said humanitarian access would depend on its assessment of the local situation, in consultation with the Red Cross. It also said Syria allows "the entry for the media with freedom of movement according to the Syrian laws and regulations."

Kofi Annan gives a statement after his address to the Security Council in New York at the United Nations headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.

UNITED NATIONS (AP)  France circulated a proposed statement to the U.N.Security Council on Monday that urges the Syrian government to immediately implement proposals by international envoy Kofi Annan to end the yearlong bloodshed.

The statement would pledge to consider "further measures"  which could include sanctions or military action  if it doesn't.

Annan, a former U.N. secretary-general, asked the council Friday to unite behind his effort to end the yearlong bloodshed that the United Nations says has killed more than 8,000 people. According to U.N. diplomats, he said the stronger and more unified the message from the Security Council, the better the chances of shifting the dynamics of the conflict.

The draft presidential statement, obtained by the Associated Press, expresses "full support" for Annan and the six-point plan he presented to Syrian President Bashar Assad during two meetings in Damascus on March 10-11 as the joint envoy for the U.N. and Arab League.

It would express the council's "gravest concern at the deteriorating situation in Syria which has resulted in a serious human rights crisis and a deplorable humanitarian situation." It would also express "profound regret" at the thousands of deaths.

Russia and China have vetoed two U.S. and European-backed resolutions that would have condemned President Bashar Assad's bloody crackdown on civilians, saying they were unbalanced and demanded an end to government attacks only, not the opposition.

The proposed statement does not address the issue of responsibility. But Russia and China are likely to oppose raising the possibility that the council would consider "further measures" if Syrian doesn't immediately implement Annan's proposals. Both countries have adamantly rejected any mention of such measures because they believe the NATO bombing campaign in Libya overstepped the council's mandate to protect civilians.

The draft calls on the Syrian government and opposition to work with Annan and "to implement fully and immediately his initial six-point plan." If adopted, the council would review implementation of Annan's plan and consider "further measures" in seven days, a time frame that is also likely to be opposed by some council members as being too short.

Britain's U.N. Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant, the current council president, told reporters the council will discuss the draft presidential statement backing Annan on Tuesday as well as a press statement proposed by Russia, Syria's closest ally, on the recent attacks in Damascus and Aleppo.

France's U.N. Ambassador Gerard Araud said he introduced a presidential statement to give quick backing to Annan because a resolution would take a week or two.

Presidential statements become part of the Security Council's permanent record and are stronger than press statements which do not. But unlike resolutions, neither statement is legally binding.

A key point in Annan's plan as spelled out in the draft calls for Syria to "commit to stop the fighting and achieve urgently an effective United Nations supervised cessation of armed violence by all parties" As these actions are being taken, Annan "shall seek similar commitments from all other armed groups to cease violence, under an effective United Nations supervision mechanism," it said.

Syria told Annan in a letter obtained Saturday by The Associated Press that it is "keen to end violence" but insisted that armed opposition groups give up their weapons first. It also demanded that Annan halt the supply and financing of weapons to the opposition.

The Syrian response fell far short of U.S. and European demands that Syrian forces stop fighting first  and even Russia's insistence that both sides lay down their arms simultaneously. But it did leave the door open for talks.

Annan has sent a five-member team to Syria to discuss practical steps to implement his proposal.

U.N. deputy spokesman Eduardo del Buey quoted Annan's spokesman, Ahmad Fawzi, as saying Monday that the team, with expertise on political, peacekeeping and mediation issues, will stay as long as it is making progress in reaching agreement on practical steps to implement Annan's proposals.

The other points in Annan's proposal, spelled out in the draft, call for Syria:

 to work with Annan in establishing "an inclusive Syrian-led political dialogue to address the legitimate aspirations and concerns of the Syrian people"

to ensure the timely delivery of humanitarian aid to all areas affected by the fighting

to intensify "the pace and scale of release of arbitrarily detained persons."

to ensure freedom of movement throughout the country for journalists

to ensure freedom of association and the right to demonstrate peacefully "as legally guaranteed."

In its response reported Saturday, Syria insisted that there have been no "random arrests" during the uprising and said humanitarian access would depend on its assessment of the local situation, in consultation with the Red Cross. It also said Syria allows "the entry for the media with freedom of movement according to the Syrian laws and regulations."

Kofi Annan gives a statement after his address to the Security Council in New York at the United Nations headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.

UNITED NATIONS (AP)  France circulated a proposed statement to the U.N.Security Council on Monday that urges the Syrian government to immediately implement proposals by international envoy Kofi Annan to end the yearlong bloodshed.

The statement would pledge to consider "further measures"  which could include sanctions or military action  if it doesn't.

Annan, a former U.N. secretary-general, asked the council Friday to unite behind his effort to end the yearlong bloodshed that the United Nations says has killed more than 8,000 people. According to U.N. diplomats, he said the stronger and more unified the message from the Security Council, the better the chances of shifting the dynamics of the conflict.

The draft presidential statement, obtained by the Associated Press, expresses "full support" for Annan and the six-point plan he presented to Syrian President Bashar Assad during two meetings in Damascus on March 10-11 as the joint envoy for the U.N. and Arab League.

It would express the council's "gravest concern at the deteriorating situation in Syria which has resulted in a serious human rights crisis and a deplorable humanitarian situation." It would also express "profound regret" at the thousands of deaths.

Russia and China have vetoed two U.S. and European-backed resolutions that would have condemned President Bashar Assad's bloody crackdown on civilians, saying they were unbalanced and demanded an end to government attacks only, not the opposition.

The proposed statement does not address the issue of responsibility. But Russia and China are likely to oppose raising the possibility that the council would consider "further measures" if Syrian doesn't immediately implement Annan's proposals. Both countries have adamantly rejected any mention of such measures because they believe the NATO bombing campaign in Libya overstepped the council's mandate to protect civilians.

The draft calls on the Syrian government and opposition to work with Annan and "to implement fully and immediately his initial six-point plan." If adopted, the council would review implementation of Annan's plan and consider "further measures" in seven days, a time frame that is also likely to be opposed by some council members as being too short.

Britain's U.N. Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant, the current council president, told reporters the council will discuss the draft presidential statement backing Annan on Tuesday as well as a press statement proposed by Russia, Syria's closest ally, on the recent attacks in Damascus and Aleppo.

France's U.N. Ambassador Gerard Araud said he introduced a presidential statement to give quick backing to Annan because a resolution would take a week or two.

Presidential statements become part of the Security Council's permanent record and are stronger than press statements which do not. But unlike resolutions, neither statement is legally binding.

A key point in Annan's plan as spelled out in the draft calls for Syria to "commit to stop the fighting and achieve urgently an effective United Nations supervised cessation of armed violence by all parties" As these actions are being taken, Annan "shall seek similar commitments from all other armed groups to cease violence, under an effective United Nations supervision mechanism," it said.

Syria told Annan in a letter obtained Saturday by The Associated Press that it is "keen to end violence" but insisted that armed opposition groups give up their weapons first. It also demanded that Annan halt the supply and financing of weapons to the opposition.

The Syrian response fell far short of U.S. and European demands that Syrian forces stop fighting first  and even Russia's insistence that both sides lay down their arms simultaneously. But it did leave the door open for talks.

Annan has sent a five-member team to Syria to discuss practical steps to implement his proposal.

U.N. deputy spokesman Eduardo del Buey quoted Annan's spokesman, Ahmad Fawzi, as saying Monday that the team, with expertise on political, peacekeeping and mediation issues, will stay as long as it is making progress in reaching agreement on practical steps to implement Annan's proposals.

The other points in Annan's proposal, spelled out in the draft, call for Syria:

 to work with Annan in establishing "an inclusive Syrian-led political dialogue to address the legitimate aspirations and concerns of the Syrian people"

to ensure the timely delivery of humanitarian aid to all areas affected by the fighting

to intensify "the pace and scale of release of arbitrarily detained persons."

to ensure freedom of movement throughout the country for journalists

to ensure freedom of association and the right to demonstrate peacefully "as legally guaranteed."

In its response reported Saturday, Syria insisted that there have been no "random arrests" during the uprising and said humanitarian access would depend on its assessment of the local situation, in consultation with the Red Cross. It also said Syria allows "the entry for the media with freedom of movement according to the Syrian laws and regulations."

If adopted, the council would review implementation of Annan's plan and consider "further measures" in seven days, a time frame that is also likely to be opposed by some council members as being too short.

Britain's U.N. Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant, the current council president, told reporters the council will discuss the draft presidential statement backing Annan on Tuesday as well as a press statement proposed by Russia, Syria's closest ally, on the recent attacks in Damascus and Aleppo.

France's U.N. Ambassador Gerard Araud said he introduced a presidential statement to give quick backing to Annan because a resolution would take a week or two.

Presidential statements become part of the Security Council's permanent record and are stronger than press statements which do not. But unlike resolutions, neither statement is legally binding.

A key point in Annan's plan as spelled out in the draft calls for Syria to "commit to stop the fighting and achieve urgently an effective United Nations supervised cessation of armed violence by all parties" As these actions are being taken, Annan "shall seek similar commitments from all other armed groups to cease violence, under an effective United Nations supervision mechanism," it said.

Syria told Annan in a letter obtained Saturday by The Associated Press that it is "keen to end violence" but insisted that armed opposition groups give up their weapons first. It also demanded that Annan halt the supply and financing of weapons to the opposition.

The Syrian response fell far short of U.S. and European demands that Syrian forces stop fighting first  and even Russia's insistence that both sides lay down their arms simultaneously. But it did leave the door open for talks.

Annan has sent a five-member team to Syria to discuss practical steps to implement his proposal.

U.N. deputy spokesman Eduardo del Buey quoted Annan's spokesman, Ahmad Fawzi, as saying Monday that the team, with expertise on political, peacekeeping and mediation issues, will stay as long as it is making progress in reaching agreement on practical steps to implement Annan's proposals.

The other points in Annan's proposal, spelled out in the draft, call for Syria:

 to work with Annan in establishing "an inclusive Syrian-led political dialogue to address the legitimate aspirations and concerns of the Syrian people"

to ensure the timely delivery of humanitarian aid to all areas affected by the fighting

to intensify "the pace and scale of release of arbitrarily detained persons."

to ensure freedom of movement throughout the country for journalists

to ensure freedom of association and the right to demonstrate peacefully "as legally guaranteed."

In its response reported Saturday, Syria insisted that there have been no "random arrests" during the uprising and said humanitarian access would depend on its assessment of the local situation, in consultation with the Red Cross. It also said Syria allows "the entry for the media with freedom of movement according to the Syrian laws and regulations."

Kofi Annan gives a statement after his address to the Security Council in New York at the United Nations headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.

UNITED NATIONS (AP)  France circulated a proposed statement to the U.N.Security Council on Monday that urges the Syrian government to immediately implement proposals by international envoy Kofi Annan to end the yearlong bloodshed.

The statement would pledge to consider "further measures"  which could include sanctions or military action  if it doesn't.

Annan, a former U.N. secretary-general, asked the council Friday to unite behind his effort to end the yearlong bloodshed that the United Nations says has killed more than 8,000 people. According to U.N. diplomats, he said the stronger and more unified the message from the Security Council, the better the chances of shifting the dynamics of the conflict.

The draft presidential statement, obtained by the Associated Press, expresses "full support" for Annan and the six-point plan he presented to Syrian President Bashar Assad during two meetings in Damascus on March 10-11 as the joint envoy for the U.N. and Arab League.

It would express the council's "gravest concern at the deteriorating situation in Syria which has resulted in a serious human rights crisis and a deplorable humanitarian situation." It would also express "profound regret" at the thousands of deaths.

Russia and China have vetoed two U.S. and European-backed resolutions that would have condemned President Bashar Assad's bloody crackdown on civilians, saying they were unbalanced and demanded an end to government attacks only, not the opposition.

The proposed statement does not address the issue of responsibility. But Russia and China are likely to oppose raising the possibility that the council would consider "further measures" if Syrian doesn't immediately implement Annan's proposals. Both countries have adamantly rejected any mention of such measures because they believe the NATO bombing campaign in Libya overstepped the council's mandate to protect civilians.

U.N. deputy spokesman Eduardo del Buey quoted Annan's spokesman, Ahmad Fawzi, as saying Monday that the team, with expertise on political, peacekeeping and mediation issues, will stay as long as it is making progress in reaching agreement on practical steps to implement Annan's proposals.

The other points in Annan's proposal, spelled out in the draft, call for Syria:

 to work with Annan in establishing "an inclusive Syrian-led political dialogue to address the legitimate aspirations and concerns of the Syrian people"

to ensure the timely delivery of humanitarian aid to all areas affected by the fighting

to intensify "the pace and scale of release of arbitrarily detained persons."

to ensure freedom of movement throughout the country for journalists

to ensure freedom of association and the right to demonstrate peacefully "as legally guaranteed."

In its response reported Saturday, Syria insisted that there have been no "random arrests" during the uprising and said humanitarian access would depend on its assessment of the local situation, in consultation with the Red Cross. It also said Syria allows "the entry for the media with freedom of movement according to the Syrian laws and regulations."

Kofi Annan gives a statement after his address to the Security Council in New York at the United Nations headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.

UNITED NATIONS (AP)  France circulated a proposed statement to the U.N.Security Council on Monday that urges the Syrian government to immediately implement proposals by international envoy Kofi Annan to end the yearlong bloodshed.

The statement would pledge to consider "further measures"  which could include sanctions or military action  if it doesn't.

Annan, a former U.N. secretary-general, asked the council Friday to unite behind his effort to end the yearlong bloodshed that the United Nations says has killed more than 8,000 people. According to U.N. diplomats, he said the stronger and more unified the message from the Security Council, the better the chances of shifting the dynamics of the conflict.

The draft presidential statement, obtained by the Associated Press, expresses "full support" for Annan and the six-point plan he presented to Syrian President Bashar Assad during two meetings in Damascus on March 10-11 as the joint envoy for the U.N. and Arab League.

It would express the council's "gravest concern at the deteriorating situation in Syria which has resulted in a serious human rights crisis and a deplorable humanitarian situation." It would also express "profound regret" at the thousands of deaths.

Russia and China have vetoed two U.S. and European-backed resolutions that would have condemned President Bashar Assad's bloody crackdown on civilians, saying they were unbalanced and demanded an end to government attacks only, not the opposition.

The proposed statement does not address the issue of responsibility. But Russia and China are likely to oppose raising the possibility that the council would consider "further measures" if Syrian doesn't immediately implement Annan's proposals. Both countries have adamantly rejected any mention of such measures because they believe the NATO bombing campaign in Libya overstepped the council's mandate to protect civilians.

The draft calls on the Syrian government and opposition to work with Annan and "to implement fully and immediately his initial six-point plan." If adopted, the council would review implementation of Annan's plan and consider "further measures" in seven days, a time frame that is also likely to be opposed by some council members as being too short.

Britain's U.N. Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant, the current council president, told reporters the council will discuss the draft presidential statement backing Annan on Tuesday as well as a press statement proposed by Russia, Syria's closest ally, on the recent attacks in Damascus and Aleppo.

France's U.N. Ambassador Gerard Araud said he introduced a presidential statement to give quick backing to Annan because a resolution would take a week or two.

Presidential statements become part of the Security Council's permanent record and are stronger than press statements which do not. But unlike resolutions, neither statement is legally binding.

A key point in Annan's plan as spelled out in the draft calls for Syria to "commit to stop the fighting and achieve urgently an effective United Nations supervised cessation of armed violence by all parties" As these actions are being taken, Annan "shall seek similar commitments from all other armed groups to cease violence, under an effective United Nations supervision mechanism," it said.

Syria told Annan in a letter obtained Saturday by The Associated Press that it is "keen to end violence" but insisted that armed opposition groups give up their weapons first. It also demanded that Annan halt the supply and financing of weapons to the opposition.

The Syrian response fell far short of U.S. and European demands that Syrian forces stop fighting first  and even Russia's insistence that both sides lay down their arms simultaneously. But it did leave the door open for talks.

Annan has sent a five-member team to Syria to discuss practical steps to implement his proposal.

Kofi Annan gives a statement after his address to the Security Council in New York at the United Nations headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.

UNITED NATIONS (AP)  France circulated a proposed statement to the U.N.Security Council on Monday that urges the Syrian government to immediately implement proposals by international envoy Kofi Annan to end the yearlong bloodshed.

The statement would pledge to consider "further measures"  which could include sanctions or military action  if it doesn't.

Annan, a former U.N. secretary-general, asked the council Friday to unite behind his effort to end the yearlong bloodshed that the United Nations says has killed more than 8,000 people. According to U.N. diplomats, he said the stronger and more unified the message from the Security Council, the better the chances of shifting the dynamics of the conflict.

The draft presidential statement, obtained by the Associated Press, expresses "full support" for Annan and the six-point plan he presented to Syrian President Bashar Assad during two meetings in Damascus on March 10-11 as the joint envoy for the U.N. and Arab League.

It would express the council's "gravest concern at the deteriorating situation in Syria which has resulted in a serious human rights crisis and a deplorable humanitarian situation." It would also express "profound regret" at the thousands of deaths.

Russia and China have vetoed two U.S. and European-backed resolutions that would have condemned President Bashar Assad's bloody crackdown on civilians, saying they were unbalanced and demanded an end to government attacks only, not the opposition.

The proposed statement does not address the issue of responsibility. But Russia and China are likely to oppose raising the possibility that the council would consider "further measures" if Syrian doesn't immediately implement Annan's proposals. Both countries have adamantly rejected any mention of such measures because they believe the NATO bombing campaign in Libya overstepped the council's mandate to protect civilians.

The draft calls on the Syrian government and opposition to work with Annan and "to implement fully and immediately his initial six-point plan." If adopted, the council would review implementation of Annan's plan and consider "further measures" in seven days, a time frame that is also likely to be opposed by some council members as being too short.

Britain's U.N. Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant, the current council president, told reporters the council will discuss the draft presidential statement backing Annan on Tuesday as well as a press statement proposed by Russia, Syria's closest ally, on the recent attacks in Damascus and Aleppo.

France's U.N. Ambassador Gerard Araud said he introduced a presidential statement to give quick backing to Annan because a resolution would take a week or two.

Presidential statements become part of the Security Council's permanent record and are stronger than press statements which do not. But unlike resolutions, neither statement is legally binding.

A key point in Annan's plan as spelled out in the draft calls for Syria to "commit to stop the fighting and achieve urgently an effective United Nations supervised cessation of armed violence by all parties" As these actions are being taken, Annan "shall seek similar commitments from all other armed groups to cease violence, under an effective United Nations supervision mechanism," it said.

Syria told Annan in a letter obtained Saturday by The Associated Press that it is "keen to end violence" but insisted that armed opposition groups give up their weapons first. It also demanded that Annan halt the supply and financing of weapons to the opposition.

The Syrian response fell far short of U.S. and European demands that Syrian forces stop fighting first  and even Russia's insistence that both sides lay down their arms simultaneously. But it did leave the door open for talks.

Annan has sent a five-member team to Syria to discuss practical steps to implement his proposal.

U.N. deputy spokesman Eduardo del Buey quoted Annan's spokesman, Ahmad Fawzi, as saying Monday that the team, with expertise on political, peacekeeping and mediation issues, will stay as long as it is making progress in reaching agreement on practical steps to implement Annan's proposals.

The other points in Annan's proposal, spelled out in the draft, call for Syria:

 to work with Annan in establishing "an inclusive Syrian-led political dialogue to address the legitimate aspirations and concerns of the Syrian people"

to ensure the timely delivery of humanitarian aid to all areas affected by the fighting

to intensify "the pace and scale of release of arbitrarily detained persons."

to ensure freedom of movement throughout the country for journalists

to ensure freedom of association and the right to demonstrate peacefully "as legally guaranteed."

In its response reported Saturday, Syria insisted that there have been no "random arrests" during the uprising and said humanitarian access would depend on its assessment of the local situation, in consultation with the Red Cross. It also said Syria allows "the entry for the media with freedom of movement according to the Syrian laws and regulations."
